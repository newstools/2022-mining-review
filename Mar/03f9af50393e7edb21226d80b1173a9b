Pensana is proud to become a launch partner of the Oh Yes! Net Zero coalition. The Oh Yes! Net Zero coalition is a group of large businesses, SMEs, public bodies, educational bodies, and the public who are taking steps, both large and small, to decarbonise Hull and the Humber region. The Humber is the largest of the UK’s six industrial clusters by emissions, accounting for 37% of the clusters’ collective CO₂ output and needs to be a key region of focus to deliver the UK’s Net Zero 2050 ambition. Pensana’s decision to locate to this region will provide benefits from working with innovative businesses on decarbonisation. This includes the recently announced cooperation agreement with Equinor New Energy, to share technical and commercial information to develop a low energy method for recycling end-of-life magnets in Saltend, moving Pensana further towards a circular solution for the rare earth material supply chain. Pensana has committed to developing a world-class sustainable supply chain for rare earths, including the production of Neodymium Praseodymium (NdPr) oxide, an essential component in the manufacture of decarbonisation products including wind turbines and electric vehicles. Pensana Chairman, Paul Atherley, commented: “We are excited to be part of The Oh Yes! Net Zero coalition and look forward to working together to help each partner and the Humber region reach its Net Zero target. “Pensana is committed to developing partnerships with organisations with shared values and goals, further illustrating our focus on creating a world-class sustainable supply chain for rare earths in the UK, to help meet the country’s decarbonisation objectives.”
