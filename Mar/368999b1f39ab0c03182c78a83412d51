Perseus Mining has updated its LOMP for its Sissingué Gold Mine and satellite deposits, Fimbiasso and Bagoé, in Côte d’Ivoire. Perseus’s Managing Director and CEO Jeff Quartermaine said: “The Sissingué Gold Mine has been an important part of Perseus’s geopolitically diversified asset portfolio since commencing commercial production in 2018 with an estimated 4.5-year mine life. Since then, the mine has consistently produced gold more than forecasts and importantly, generated significant amounts of free cashflow. “This updated LOMP incorporates the processing of ore from satellite deposits at Fimbiasso and Bagoé as well as the Sissingué Gold Mine, and results in the life of the Sissingué operation being extended out till at least March 2026 which enables Perseus to continue generating material benefits for all our stakeholders, including the residents of our host communities at Fimbiasso and Bagoé.” RELATED:Perseus Mining looks to acquire Orca Gold Highlights
