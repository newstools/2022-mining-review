Sitatunga Resources’ East Manganese mine has welcomed its first learnership recruits. The artisan learnership programme, which started in September 2021, includes electricians, fitters and turners, and diesel mechanics. During their learnerships, the apprentices will receive workplace (on-the-job) training and will also be sent for institutional learning at the Joe Morolong Training Centre. “The learnerships aim to enable the apprentices to complete their red seal certification by the time they have completed the programme in order to become qualified artisans. The skills, knowledge, experience and artisan certification gained during the learnership will increase the apprentices’ employability prospects,” states Menar Social Labour Plan Manager Nthabiseng Ocia Mueti. Moreover, Nthabiseng highlights that the learnership programme provides access to education, training and employment opportunities to the most vulnerable of persons, namely the youth in the host mine community.
