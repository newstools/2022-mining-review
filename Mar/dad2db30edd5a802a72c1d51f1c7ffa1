Cora Gold has commenced at the Company’s Sanankoro Gold Project in southern Mali. Bert Monro, CEO of Cora, commented: “We have multiple workstreams underway as we set our sights on delivering a Definitive Feasibility Study in the coming months, alongside a resource expansion programme, which we believe will further enhance both the quantum and confidence levels of our MRE. “We have consistently demonstrated Sanankoro’s potential to become an open-pittable, free-digging oxide mine and work will accelerate throughout 2022 as we look to make this into reality. We look forward to sharing updates from this drill programme over the coming weeks.” Delighted to note that two @_CapitalLimited reverse circulation rigs are on site and turning on this 7,500m resource programme at our flagship Sanankoro Gold Project in southern Mali.
