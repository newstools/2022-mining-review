Aton Resources has updated investors on the latest developments at its Hamama West project. Hamama West is in the Company’s 100% owned Abu Marawat Concession, in the Eastern Desert of Egypt. “We are very pleased to announce that we have entered into an agreement with Capital Drilling to undertake a new RC drilling programme at Hamama West, as we look to advance the project towards its development as the next gold mine in Egypt”, said Tonno Vahk, Interim CEO. “We have worked with Capital at Hamama since 2016, and we are very much looking forward to renewing our relationship with them again. The diamond drilling programme is continuing at Rodruin and we expect to release the next positive tranche of results as soon as they become available. “Aton continues to go full steam ahead on the ground in Egypt, and we are excited by the prospect of a very busy period ahead, drilling at the two projects, as we work to advance both Hamama West and Rodruin towards their development into new gold mines.” Highlights:
