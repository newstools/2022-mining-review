Fortuna Silver Mines has announced a maiden Inferred Mineral Resource estimate for the Sunbird discovery located at its Séguéla gold Project in Côte d´Ivoire. Paul Weedon, Senior Vice President of Exploration of Fortuna, commented: “The Sunbird discovery, with important similar geological characteristics to the nearby previously defined deposits, remains open along strike and at depth, providing excellent potential for additional growth based on the successful ongoing expansion drilling program presently being conducted.” Weedon continued: “We regard the definition of the Sunbird deposit as a single step in the discovery journey with many more exploration targets identified and yet to be tested.” Weedon concluded: “We remain very encouraged at the potential for further exploration work programs to help in determining the ultimate scale of the Séguéla gold Project.” Fortuna estimates the Sunbird deposit contains an Inferred Mineral Resource of 3.4 Mt at an average grade of 3.16 g/t Au containing 350,000 gold ounces. The Inferred Mineral Resource will not materially change the existing Mineral Resource estimate at the Séguéla gold Project or impact its current construction plan.
