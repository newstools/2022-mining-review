Pan African has secured five prospecting concessions in north-eastern Sudan covering an area of almost 1,100 km2 and located approximately 70 km northwest of Port Sudan. The Group was awarded the licences by Sudan’s Ministry of Minerals for a period of three years, with the option to renew for a further two years. Cobus Loots, Pan African’s CEO commented: “Our management team has been visiting Sudan for the last two years to identify prospective gold mining sites. We believe that the Block 12 concessions are highly prospective, and we look forward to reporting exploration results from these properties in due course. “Our exploration programme will be phased, with expenditure of approximately US$7 million expected to be incurred during the first three years, to ensure we limit the Group’s financial risk. “Furthermore, before making any material investment decisions we would need to be comfortable with the country’s operating environment.” “Recently announced investments in Sudan by other international mining companies, including Perseus Mining’s recently announced US$155 million acquisition of Orca Gold, validates our views on the region’s prospectively for gold exploration and mining. “In the medium to longer term, these Sudanese exploration activities have the potential to further add production growth to Pan African’s already impressive project pipeline.”
