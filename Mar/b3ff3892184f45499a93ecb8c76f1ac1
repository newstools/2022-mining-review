Shareholders are referred to the SENS announcement dated 25 January 2021, informing shareholders that the disinterested members of the Board have appointed Robinson Ramaite, a non-executive director of the Company, as interim Group CEO of the Company with effect from 15 March 2021. Shareholders are advised that the disinterested members of the Board have appointed Ramaite as Group CEO with effect from 1 April 2022, for a period of 2 years. The appointment would allow for a managed transition as Wescoal moves from a pure coal mining and trading company into a diversified investment company, and it will also allow the Board to complete proper succession planning processes in relation to the appointment of the future Group CEO. Ramaite’s appointment will further ensure an experienced hand at the helm to effectively execute the new strategic direction of the Company under the proposed new name of “Salungano Group”, as per the circular distributed to shareholders on 31 January 2022.
