“We are deeply saddened by the tragic events continuing to occur in Ukraine and hope for a peaceful resolution to the crisis. Through the Caterpillar Foundation, we are donating more than $1 million to support both urgent and long-term needs of the Ukraine humanitarian crisis.” We are complying with all applicable laws and evolving sanctions, while remaining focused on our employees, dealers and customers. Operations in Russia have become increasingly challenging, including supply chain disruptions and sanctions, and we are suspending operations in our Russian manufacturing facilities. We recognize this is a time of incredible uncertainty for our valued employees, and we will continue to look for ways to support them.
