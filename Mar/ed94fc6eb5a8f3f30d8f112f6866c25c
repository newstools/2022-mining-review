AVZ Minerals, located south of the Democratic Republic of Congo will be admitted to S&P/ASX 200 Index. The admission will be effective prior to the open of trading on March 21. The inclusion of AVZ in the S&P/ASX 200 Index follows its progress to developing its world-class, tier 1 Manono Lithium and Tin Project in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). “AVZ’s admission to the S&P/ASX 200 Index recognizes growing investor appetite and confidence in the company and the DRC being a reputable jurisdiction that can host the sustainable development of battery minerals projects, that is required to support the global green energy transition,” said AVZ’s Managing Director, Nigel Ferguson. The company stated its regular consultation with the DRC government authorities that are undertaking the Mining License assessment and says they remain confident of delivering a favorable outcome for all stakeholders. AVZ holds a 75% interest in the Manono Project, located 500 km north of Lubumbashi in the Democratic Republic of Congo, hosting the world class Roche Dure Mineral Resource, one of the largest undeveloped hard rock lithium deposits in the world. The Manono Project is strategically positioned as a clean, sustainable source of lithium, significantly contributing to the green energy transition, feeding the global lithium-ion battery value chain.
