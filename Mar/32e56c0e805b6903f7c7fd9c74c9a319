Altus Strategies has executed a SPA with Firering Strategic Minerals  for the sale of the Company’s wholly-owned Toura nickel-cobalt licence application located Côte d’Ivoire. In consideration for the Project, Firering will grant the Company a Gross Revenue Royalty of up to 1.0% on nickel and cobalt sales from the Project and pay the Company €15,000. Steven Poulton, Chief Executive of Altus, commented: “We are pleased to generate this new nickel-cobalt royalty on our Toura application in Côte d’Ivoire, which is strategically located in an emerging and highly prospective nickel-cobalt province. Altus will receive a gross revenue royalty of up to 1.0% on any future production from the project and a nominal cash consideration upfront. “This transaction illustrates the value of our ‘boots on the ground’ approach, where Altus can generate royalties at low cost, by directly staking and monetising projects. We look forward to following Firering’s progress as it advances the Project.” Highlights:
