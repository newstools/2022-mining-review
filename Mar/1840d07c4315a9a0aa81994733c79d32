African Rainbow Minerals has signed a sale and purchase agreement for the acquisition of the Bokoni Mine from Anglo American Platinum and Atlatsa Resources, subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions precedent. The acquisition gives ARM an opportunity to develop Bokoni Mine’s large, high-grade resource which will enable ARM to scale its PGM portfolio, improve its global competitiveness and pursue further value-accretive organic growth. Bokoni Mine was placed on care and maintenance in October 2017 owing mainly to adverse market conditions. We are developing a new mine plan for Bokoni Mine which will focus predominantly on mining the UG2 resource employing fully mechanised mining methods and targeting predominantly on-reef development. This plan targets better ground conditions and higher-grade mining areas, while fully leveraging existing mining and processing infrastructure. We will concurrently evaluate early mining opportunities to capitalise on the current strong PGM basket prices. The new mine plan is expected to improve efficiencies, reduce unit costs and provide early revenue. The focus for the next 12 months will be to finalise a definitive feasibility study (DFS) and in parallel obtain all the requisite mining approvals and fulfil all conditions precedent as per the agreements concluded. This will enable ARM to commence mining operations in 2023. ARM envisages development capital of approximately R5.3 billion (in real 2021 terms) to be spent over three years to ramp up the mine to a steady-state production of approximately 300 000 ounces of 6E PGM and 255 000 tonnes of chromitite concentrate per annum. Steady state is expected to be achieved from 2028 onwards. We continued to invest in our existing operations with segmental capital expenditure of R1 933 million for the period (1H F2021: R1 877 million). This included attributable capitalised waste stripping at the iron ore operations of R277 million (1H F2021: R271 million).
