Mkango Resources has successfully produced neodymium and praseodymium enriched rare earth carbonate from the final stages of hydrometallurgical piloting at ANSTO in Australia for the Songwe Hill Rare Earths Project in Malawi. Piloting is an integral part of the feasibility study for Songwe, with Mkango joining the ranks of very few rare earth companies globally which have reached this stage of development. Mkango has now successfully completed flotation piloting and all six hydrometallurgy pilot campaigns, testing all aspects of the processing flow sheet. The piloting of the hydrometallurgy processing flowsheet is a critical step towards commercialisation of the Songwe project. The feed for the hydrometallurgy pilot plant was flotation concentrate derived from the highly successful flotation pilot programme completed last year. William Dawes, Chief Executive of Mkango stated: “Completion of piloting is another major milestone for the development of Songwe and the related Pulawy separation plant in Poland, as Mkango moves towards finalisation of the feasibility study for Songwe. “This puts Mkango in a rare class of having an independent rare earths project at this advanced stage of development. Through its investments across the supply chain, Mkango is uniquely positioned to be a future producer of rare earth oxides, recycled alloys and magnets, the latter through its 42% strategic interest in short loop rare earth magnet recycler, HyProMag.”
