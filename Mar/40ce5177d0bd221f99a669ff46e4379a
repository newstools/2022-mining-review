First Quantum Minerals has reiterated its commitment to invest further in Zambia’s mining sector, but has clarified that it has no plans to acquire Mopani Copper Mines (MCM) nor Konkola Copper Mines (KCM), contrary to media reports. The company has pledged to support government’s drive towards growing the nation’s copper production, and is working towards investing in its S3 expansion project at Kansanshi mine in Solwezi which will increase production output and prolong the life of mine. In addition, preparatory works are also underway for the company’s Enterprise nickel production project near its Sentinel mine in North-Western Province. The company (and the mining industry at large) is keen on seeing positive developments in policies that will attract investment in the sector to reach the ultimate goal of three million tonnes of copper production in the near future
