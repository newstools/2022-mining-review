Eastern Platinum and its subsidiary Barplats Mines have announced the completion of the previously announced sale of the Maroelabult resource property with Eland Platinum. The sales agreement provided for the sale of the mining rights, immovable property, infrastructure, and equipment of the Maroelabult resource property located near Brits in South Africa, with Eland assuming all rehabilitation obligations related to the property. Total cash consideration of R20 million (approximately US$1.3 million) was received on March 9, 2022, after the transfer of legal title and various legal and regulatory obligations required in South Africa were completed. Since October 25, 2019, Eland assumed the care and maintenance costs and services of the Maroelabult Assets. Diana Hu, CEO of the Company commented: “Eastplats is pleased to close this transaction with Eland and to monetize Maroelabult. The Company remains focused to advance its core assets, including restarting the Zandfontein underground at the Crocodile River Mine and continue to bring value to its stakeholders.”
