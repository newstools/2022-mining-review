AIM-listed Atlantic Lithium Limited the fully-funded, African- focussed lithium exploration and development company on track to become West Africa’s first lithium producing mine, has announced final high-grade infill drilling results from the December 2021 campaign at its Ewoyaa Lithium Project in Ghana. The company recently announced an updated Scoping Study and increased JORC compliant Mineral Resource Estimate of 21.3Mt @ 1.31% Li2O resulting in a significant improvement in project economics and life of mine. HIGHLIGHTS: o  GRDT0453: 30m at 1.5% Li2O from 85.6 m o  GRC0574: 29m at 1.35% Li2O from 150 m o  GRDT0479: 23m at 1.7% Li2O from 114 m o  GRDT0505: 27.7m at 1.15% Li2O from 53.8 m o  GRC0596: 21m at 1.47% Li2O from 45 m o  GRC0600: 19m at 1.61% Li2O from 42 m o  GRDT0476: 16.9m at 1.62% Li2O from 130.1 m o  GRC0591: 15m at 1.76% Li2O from 65 m o  GRC0616: 15m at 1.59% Li2O from 249 m o  GRC0618: 15m at 1.54% Li2O from 159 m o  GRC0590: 16m at 1.44% Li2O from 194 m o  GRDT0481: 15m at 1.47% Li2O from 97 m o  GRC0619: 17m at 1.28% Li2O from 172 m o  GRC0593: 11m at 1.89% Li2O from 122 m o  GRDT0467: 14.6m at 1.4% Li2O from 65.2 m o  LOM revenues exceeding US$3.43bn, Post-tax NPV8 of US$789m, IRR of 194% over 11.4 years o  US$70m capital cost with industry-leading payback period of <1 year o  C1 cash operating costs of US$249 per tonne of 6% lithium spodumene concentrate Free on Board (“FOB”) Ghana Port, after by-product credits o  Pre-tax NPV8 of US$1.23bn and EBITDA of US$2.02bn for LOM o  Average EBITDA of US$178m per annum Read: West Africa’s first lithium production on the horizon Commenting on the company’s latest progress, Vincent Mascolo, CEO of Atlantic Lithium, said, “Drilling results received confirm grade and continuity where tested across the Ewoyaa deposits, including a broad, high-grade intersection of 30 m at 1.5% Li2O at the Ewoyaa Northeast deposit, as well as new zones of mineralisation defined outside of the current Resource footprint. “Multiple high-grade drill intersections have been returned over the eastern strike extension of the Grasscutter West deposit; all of which occur outside of the Resource and expected add further tonnes. “Additional assay results received over the Ewoyaa Sill target continue to impress, with high-grade mineralisation and good widths occurring in flat lying structures favourable for tonnage addition and low strip ratio; also, outside of the Resource which is expected add further tonnes. “Our resource continues to grow, and the upside of the project is clear; not only do we believe that project metrics will improve significantly beyond the current defined mine life, however we also see further potential for substantial economic improvement due to the recent increases in spodumene concentrate pricing which have far exceeded our initial SC6 price modelling parameters. “We believe these fundamentals continue to demonstrate Ewoyaa as an industry-leading asset; with the Atlantic Lithium ideally positioned to benefit from the growing lithium market; we look forward to progressing the project towards production and establishing Atlantic Lithium as a new player in the lithium supply chain.”
