Namibia Critical Metals has provided an update on exploration activities on its 95% owned Erongo and Grootfontein Projects. The company has completed a multiple tool geophysical survey over the Kanona Target on the Erongo Project for drill target generation over previously defined coinciding gold and arsenic anomalies: Darrin Campbell, President, stated: “We are encouraged by the results from our early-stage exploration activities throughout 2021 and are excited to begin the first phase of drilling on the Erongo Project where solid exploration by systematic soil sampling and multiple tool ground geophysics has identified a first drill ready target.”
