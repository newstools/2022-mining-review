Shanta Gold has provided an exploration update for the West Kenya Project in Kenya. The West Kenya drilling campaign continues to deliver high-grade results, with resource at Isulu & Bushiangala converting 117koz grading 7.04 g/t Indicated at a conversion rate of over 100% as of 31.06.21. An upgraded MRE will be announced in a few weeks. https://t.co/t3yemYl3o5 pic.twitter.com/etl4YM8ZqG Eric Zurrin, CEO, comments: “The latest phase of drilling at West Kenya has continued to deliver outstanding results, ensuring that this remains the most consistently high-grade drilling programme we’ve ever conducted at any asset in Shanta’s history. “The primary focus during the 2021 drilling campaign was to upgrade the high-grade resource at Isulu and Bushiangala, and I am pleased to report that we succeeded in this, converting 117,000 oz grading 7.04 g/t indicated at a conversion rate of over 100%. “Following this success, we have added a third drill rig to upgrade the mineral resource estimate. The program is at the second phase that targets all the zones to approximately 450-500m below surface. “Looking forward to the next few weeks, we will announce the upgraded mineral resource estimate at Isulu and Bushiangala, and we are pleased to report that we will announce new maiden resources at Ramula and a remodelled compliant resource at Bumbo following some very encouraging results in the district targets. This is a hugely exciting time for the Company and our stakeholders as the West Kenyan resource expands toward a multi-million-ounce gold district comparable with other prolific greenstone belts in the world.” A recent visit to Singida by our CEO Eric Zurrin & #SHG directors has bolstered our enthusiasm for the project. With a start date of early Q1 2023, the project is now 45% completed, and will transform Shanta to a 100,000 oz/pa producer. Read more: https://t.co/B54eaJGXT2 pic.twitter.com/7wk27tPiPR
