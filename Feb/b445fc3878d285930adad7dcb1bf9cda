With the aid of modern technologies, a mining operation can excel in its operations. And a single digital tool or platform can do the trick. “One needs to understand the day-to-day work or activities that will be happening on site before you can get to that point,” says Mosa Marumo, who is learning how best to improve mining efficiency at East Manganese. Mosa (24) from Kuruman in the Northern Cape is a Mining Engineer Intern at East Manganese. He started working at the mine in May 2021. He holds a diploma in Mining Engineering and B-Tech in Mining Engineering from the University of Johannesburg. He is also studying towards a Postgraduate Diploma in Business Administration at the University of Pretoria’s Gordon Institute of Business Science (GIBS). Having previously worked at an underground diamond mine, Mosa is now expanding his horizon of experience and knowledge in an opencast Manganese operation. At East Manganese, Mosa works a lot with the production foremen on production flows. Then on days when there is blasting at the site, he works with the drill and blast team. “I help them with the priming, which entails preparing the surface for the blast and help them with the charging up until the blast is initiated. I also worked with the mine planner to get a better understanding of the mine development plan,” notes Mosa. “It’s just incredible to be part of something where I’m learning and gaining important new skills and knowledge,” he enthuses.
