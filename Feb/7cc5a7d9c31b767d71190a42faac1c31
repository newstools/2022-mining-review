AVZ Minerals has reached agreement with Suzhou CATH Energy Technologies (CATH) to complete its US$240 million investment into the Manono Lithium and Tin Project. Further to the Company’s ASX Announcements on 27 September 2021 and 30 November 2021, the parties have now agreed to waive the following conditions precedent: It is anticipated that completion of the proposed transaction will occur during March 2022, allowing for the commencement of a multi-faceted global joint venture between AVZ and CATH focussed on multiple aspects of the battery metals supply chain. AVZ’s Managing Director, Nigel Ferguson, said: “Finalising our agreement with CATH provides certainty of funding to progress development of the Manono Project, pending the award of our Mining Licence and Collaboration Development Agreement from the DRC Government.” “We are in close consultation with the DRC Government authorities that are undertaking the Mining Licence assessment and are confident of delivering a favourable outcome for all stakeholders – most importantly the people of the DRC and our shareholders.”
