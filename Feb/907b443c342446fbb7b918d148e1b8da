Akobo Minerals, the Scandinavian-based gold exploration and mining company, recently released preliminary results of new resource estimates from its Segele gold project in Ethiopia that demonstrate bonanza gold grade results. Specifically, the results, from laboratory testing, inspection, certification and verification solutions company, ALS (Ireland), show: Read: Akobo Minerals: First gold mover advantage in Ethiopia Results from an additional 30 holes (approximately 2 000 samples) are expected to be delivered soon and will include all samples needed to perform an updated resource estimate. Once the outstanding results are received, the data will be handed to SRK (Australasia) to complete the mineral resource update. Akobo Minerals released the result of its first Segele mineral resource estimate in April 2021, with an inferred mineral resource totalling 52,410oz at an average grade of 20.9g/t. That resource estimate covered a gold mineralization in a narrow high-grade shoot from 30 m at the shallowest to 130 m at the deepest. These new assays have demonstrated that the high-grade gold mineralisation extends to at least 240 m below the surface – and quite possibly deeper. Jørgen Evjen, CEO of Akobo Minerals, said, “We eagerly anticipate the full results of the mineral resource estimate from geology and resource specialist, SRK, which will be undertaken as soon as all results are in from ALS. The engineering design within our scoping study shows that the Segele mine should be a high-margins operation, with an all-in production cost of around $250 per ounce. We anticipate limited mining production to begin at the end of 2022, with production peaking in mid-2023.” “These new results support our belief that we can maintain peak production for longer than calculated in our original scoping study. We eagerly await the new estimate,” he concluded.
