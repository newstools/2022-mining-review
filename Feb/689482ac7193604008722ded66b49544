Mako Gold has received assay results from 25 reverse circulation (RC) holes from the ongoing 10,000 m drill program at the Gogbala Prospect, within the Company’s flagship Napié Project in Côte d’Ivoire. Gogbala is located on a +23km soil anomaly and coincident 30km-long Napié Fault. Mako’s Managing Director, Peter Ledwidge commented: “We are pleased with the ongoing results from our extensional drilling at the Gogbala Prospect. Having 18 of 25 holes return significant gold results indicates how widely mineralised the Gogbala Prospect is. “These results will add ounces to the upcoming maiden Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE) scheduled for Q2-CY22. “In addition to the positive results returned from the 2km-long high-priority maiden MRE zone, further promising intersects were returned outside that zone, which highlights the blue sky that remains at Gogbala and the whole Napié permit. “Extensional drilling is ongoing at Gogbala in order to maximize the size of the upcoming MRE. We look forward to providing further results as assays are received.”
