Human Resources Administrator Drieka Lubbe at East Manganese is affectionally known as the ‘GM’ or General Mom because she is always running around helping people in any way possible. She started at East Manganese in September 2020. Having lived in Hotazel, with her husband for over 14 years Drieka has developed a close attachment to the Kalahari and the people who live in it. She works closely with Site Manager Marcus Goosen, does general admin and is responsible for payroll which requires checking timesheets and leave forms that have been submitted. “We are a small team so we need to assist one another wherever possible, which is why teamwork is so important for all of us. It is very exciting to be part of a new mine because like a baby there will be lots of growing pains, but it is great to be part of it in the beginning of the mine and learn everything about it Drieka states. In a matter of months, she has seen the site develop from: the delivery of the mining machines, to the opening of the pit and the construction of various parts of the site that are necessary to have a functional mine. When Drieka arrived on site there was virtually just the office area and every day since the site has been consistently transforming into a fully-fledged mining operation. “I enjoy working with people and I’m thrilled to be part of this new mining operation at East Manganese,” Drieka enthuses.
