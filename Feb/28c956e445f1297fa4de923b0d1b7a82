“2021 was a pivotal year for Lucara, having de-risked our future growth strategy with the sanction of the fully financed, Karowe underground expansion project, conservatively estimated to add $4 billion to future revenues and extend mine life to at least 2040,” comments Eira Thomas, President & CEO. “As important, the diamond market continued to gain momentum throughout the year, supported by improving fundamentals that reflect declining global rough diamond supply combined with rising demand and record diamond jewelry sales. “Higher diamond prices combined with solid operational performance at the mine and Lucara’s novel, diversified approach to diamond sales through HB, Clara and traditional tenders has delivered strong revenues for the Company in 2021, demonstrating a full recovery from the challenges of the pandemic, and reflecting a much better outlook for 2022 and beyond as we continue to benefit from one of the strongest diamond markets we have seen in the better part of a decade.” Highlights:
