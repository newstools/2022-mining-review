Rainbow Rare Earths has announced positive results from the ongoing phased test work programme at its Phalaborwa Project in South Africa. The test work is being conducted in conjunction with ANSTO Minerals in Australia, a world-leading critical and strategic metals processing expert and K-Technologies, the processing technology developer located in the USA . The results of the test work are enabling Rainbow to develop an economic rare earths extraction flowsheet currently as part of the feasibility study for the project.  Results to date have provided the company with additional optimisation opportunities to explore, which can reduce both operating and capital costs for the project.  The next phase of the test work programme is now underway, which includes a number of trade-off and project optimisation studies. The key findings include the following: More on speciality minerals Rainbow Rare Earths CEO, George Bennett, commented, “We are delighted by this positive test work and are very reassured that results received to date continue to demonstrate Phalaborwa’s robust fundamentals. The studies have identified several key opportunities for capital and operating cost savings as well as underscoring the significant environmental benefits of the Project. The potential to participate further downstream in the value chain and produce rare earth oxides with 99.5-99.9% purity has been confirmed by K-Tech’s study, which also highlights flexibility for phased project development if required. “By getting this stage of process flow sheet definition right, investigating the highlighted optimisation and trade-off opportunities identified by our considerable work to date, we aim to realise the full value of Phalaborwa and develop a responsible, independent Western rare earths supply chain.”
