Orezone Gold Corporation has provided drill results from the first 6 holes of the Phase II program at P17S-NE extension along the P17 mineralized trend at the Bomboré Gold Project in Burkina Faso. The Phase II program is a follow up to Phase I (completed in June 2021) which intersected several high-grade zones related to a folded mineralized granodiorite that extends outside of the existing reserves and resources at P17S-NE. Continuing the success from the Phase I program, the initial results from the Phase II program confirm the continuity of mineralization at surface and the extension down dip along the P17S-NE zone. The system remains open at depth and to the north. Drilling highlights Commenting on the results, Patrick Downey, President and CEO stated, “Hole BD1081 was a significant step-out hole and is one of the best holes drilled to date at P17S. It confirms the down-dip continuity and extends the system further towards P17. “Also of significance are the multiple near surface intercepts from this recent drill program. These results confirm the consistency and repeatability of the folding patterns both near surface and down plunge indicating a robust and continuous near surface mineralized system. “Our drilling in 2021 and 2022 has been outside of the current reserve pit and intersected zones that are still open at depth and now warrant drilling beyond the current Phase II program. Assay results for the remaining 3 holes at P17S are expected in the coming weeks. The Company has now commenced drilling at the P17 target, some 1.7 km north of P17S, to advance the definition of this deposit and better delineate the folding pattern and the potential for extensions at depth and towards the P17S-NE deposit.
