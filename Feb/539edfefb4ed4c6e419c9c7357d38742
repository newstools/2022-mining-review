Contango Holdings has provided an update relating to operations at the 100%-owned Garalo-Ntiela Gold Project in Mali. Carl Esprey, Chief Executive Officer of Contango Holdings, said: “Shareholders will be aware that Garalo-Ntiela has proved to be considerably larger in terms of resource quantum than originally modelled by our team, presenting the Company with a significant opportunity. “Given the potential scale of Garalo-Ntiela, the Company has benefited from heightened interest in the project by third parties. Whilst these discussions are at a relatively early stage, it certainly highlights the optionality we have with this project and the international interest which has been generated by our work so far. “With our Lubu coking coal project in Zimbabwe remaining on track for first production at the end of the current quarter, it is a very exciting period for Contango and I look forward to updating the market on both projects due course.” Garalo-Ntiela Gold Project Garalo-Ntiela Project Background The combined Garalo-Ntiela Project covers an area of 161.5km2 and is in the department of Bougouni within the Sikasso region in southern Mali, 200km south-south-east of Bamako and close to the Guinea border. The project is surrounded by several multi-million-ounce gold deposits and the region is home to some of the world’s leading gold miners, which has helped to establish Mali as the third largest gold producer in Africa. An NI 43-101 Independent Technical Report delivered in March 2021 highlighted the potential for the Garalo to have up to 2Moz Resource. The Company believes that there is still room for improvement over and above this threshold as, in addition to G1 and G3 targets (the basis for 2Moz), numerous other clusters of anomalous zones with potential for gold discovery have been identified in both the Garalo and contiguous Ntiela permit area.
