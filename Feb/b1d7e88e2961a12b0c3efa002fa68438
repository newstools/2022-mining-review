Following Sibanye-Stillwater’s acquisition of Lonmin’s operations in Marikana in December 2019, Thabisile has led from the forefront of turning around the tragic legacy associated with Marikana to a positive legacy of restitution and renewal as part of the Marikana Renewal Programme. The Marikana Renewal programme is inspired by the philosophy of the Letsema Engagement Process, which is anchored on the following three pillars: To date, under the Marikana Renewal Programme, Thabisile has established broad-based community engagement platforms with communities living within and around Marikana. In 2020 she led an investment of R116 180 000.00 being invested by Sibanye-Stillwater in Social and Labour Plans covering critical infrastructure development programmes such as improvement and construction of bulk water services, roads, schools, and public healthcare facilities in partnership with the Local Traditional Authority and local municipalities (Rustenburg and Madibeng). The Renewal Programme has also ensured that widows of miners who tragically lost their lives in 2012 are provided with houses. Furthermore, through the Sixteen-Eight Trust, Sibanye-Stillwater funds the educational needs of the dependent children of those who died in the Marikana tragedy. Gender equality programmes, introduced to prevent and raise awareness about gender-based violence and economic restoration initiatives through the District Development Model, are undertaken to build sustainable alternative economies beyond mining. Thabisile has a career spanning two decades in the public and private sector specialising in stakeholder engagement, curriculum development and training. She has served in various roles in communications and public relations at Anglo American Platinum, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, University of South Africa, Centre for Public Relations and Communications and the Commission for Gender Equality.
