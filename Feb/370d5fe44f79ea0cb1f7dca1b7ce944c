By the time you read this Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana would have delivered his maiden budget speech to the nation. As some of us ponder over how much more a tipple will cost because of an increase in sin tax, it must also be noted that this year is the first time that infrastructure has been listed as a separate budget item. The Infrastructure Investment Plan was approved by Cabinet in May 2020 and forms a central part of the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan (ERRP) aimed at stimulating economic growth and job creation announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa in October 2020. The Plan was highlighted as the “flywheel to economic growth” by the president and contains 62 projects across the country in various sectors and from all three spheres of government, state-owned entities and the private sector. Addressing the media yesterday, Minister of Public Works and Infrastructure, Patricia de Lille stated that plans are also in place to help speed up the implementation of infrastructure projects. According to a News 24 article published earlier today, this includes bypassing Treasury’s Budget Facility for Infrastructure (BFI) process which in known to cause delays in project implementation. While ease of doing business, transparency and tax incentives are drawcards to attract investment, proper infrastructure also helps to sway an investor’s decision. This will be the case for mining companies who wish to operate in the country. By cutting out the red tape and speeding up the process to implement infrastructure projects, this this bodes well for the country if it is to attract international investment into its mining sector.
