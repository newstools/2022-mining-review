In a world that speaks of sustainable environmental practices, the coal industry has yearned to have its voice heard. At the recent 2022 COALSAFE conference, the South African Colliery Manager’s Association (SACM) laid the platform to highlight the relevance of coal. Hlengiwe Motaung writes. In recent years, the coal mining industry has come under much scrutiny following the strongly adopted environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) principles. Under the theme Sustainable mining sustains us all, the summit that brought various stakeholders within the coal mining industry together, saw presentations that encouraged safe and responsible mining of the non-renewable resource. The conference kicked off with a moment of silence for fallen miners. Since 2019, coal mine fatalities have surged from 51 to 71, leaving the industry’s leaders concerned. “Injuries and fatalities usually take place because of neglecting safety protocol. Please don’t resort to stopping if it is not planned” said David Msiza, chief inspector of mines from the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy. Although airborne pollutants and noise exposures numbers remain steady, Mzisa applauded mining companies for handling the COVID-19 pandemic with care. Out of a recorded          62 730 known cases, 743 resulted in deaths. On the question of whether the country is ready to transition from coal to renewable resources such as solar, hydro, and wind power by 2050, most parties differed. CEO of Thungela Resources, July Ndlovu spoke on the company’s willingness to find more efficient ways to use clean coal technologies to curb climate change. “We are a generation of miners who know how to mine responsibly, in a way that will leave a legacy to future generations.” He also spoke about the responsibility that mining companies have towards communities and the harsh impacts that may be felt by an abrupt transition. “This transition shouldn’t leave the poor and vulnerable behind,” he added. Ndlovu also mentioned the relevance of coal usage, citing the current war between Ukraine and Russia, which has left many countries stranded over oil and gas prices. “Europe’s coal burn rate has been at its highest in 30 years. This indicates that coal shall remain a staple resource for years to come.” Just transition imperative Embodying these sentiments was Irvin Jim of the Nation Union of Metal Workers of South Africa. Jim insists on a just transition. “NUMSA has been clear that we are not against the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy, but we have emphasised that first, there must be an open and democratic debate about the kind of energy mix that will ensure a reliable supply of energy to power our economy and our communities. We have insisted on a just transition which must happen at a pace and cost that our country can afford” he said in closing. Since the introduction of corporate social investments policies, mining companies have prioritised their contributions toward the communities in which they mine. But these efforts, says Nolitha Fakude (president of the Minerals Council South Africa) seem to be overlooked. “One wonders why is it that our narrative, though we are doing a lot of positive things-,continues to be stubbornly negative. We must do something about this” she said. The MSCA president who is also Anglo American’s chairperson continued her call for the inclusion of women within the mining sector. Rounding off presentations was The World Coal Association. CEO Michelle Manook was adamant about phasing out coal by the year 2050 citing her views from the 2019 integrated resource plan. “Coal underpins a large part of the world economy and will continue to play a significant role in electricity generation in South Africa in the foreseeable future” she concluded.
