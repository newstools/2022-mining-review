A major milestone for transformation and gender empowerment was achieved for ZAC in January 2022 when Zinhle Nkabinde (38) was appointed as the first female shift boss at Outcrop Shaft. This capped off a major career milestone for Zinhle, who was also the first female Miner to work at Outcrop when she started her career as a miner in 2015. Zinhle started at ZAC in 2007 as a Human Resources (HR) Officer, as she holds a Diploma in Human Resources Management. She served as an HR Officer until 2011 when she was appointed as a Payroll Officer. “In 2015, I saw a notice advertising opportunities for people who wanted to study mining. I applied and was successful, and was sent to study at Colliery Training College, in Emalahleni, Mpumalanga. I returned later that year as a Learner Miner and in 2016 I was appointed officially as a Miner,” Zinhle states. Zinhle recounts that her interest in mining started when she was working in HR and Payroll, where she would have to go underground to do labour verifications. She noticed that at the time there were very few women working underground. Zinhle vowed to herself that if the opportunity arose, she would jump at the opportunity. Subsequently, she has achieved the first part of her goal and has attained several certificates including for Blasting, Continuous Miners, Gas Testing, Flame Proofing and Competent A (Roof Support). “At first it was a challenge being the only woman miner as some men were suspicious of a woman working underground in the mine. My strategy from day one was to make sure that I did everything without fault. It was important to earn their respect and for them to respect me. I was fortunate to have good Mine Captains namely Bekkie Booyens and Richard Kleinhans, who were very supportive throughout the time I worked with them,” Zinhle states. Zinhle says that both Bekkie and Richard said to her on her first day that she would not receive special treatment for being a female Miner and Zinhle was delighted to hear that. “I didn’t want to become a Miner to get special treatment, I always wanted to be there on merit and I performed every task and worked in every section just as my male colleagues did.” Zinhle has also worked as a Continuous Miner Operator at Ngwabe shaft but is currently based at Outcrop. Zinhle says that the thrill of drilling and blasting, safely and cost-efficiently every day in a production shaft is something she enjoys immensely. She adds that the number of women working at the mine had increased markedly over the last few years. This was attributable to Menar and ZAC’s active efforts to promote women in mining throughout the operation. “ZAC has granted me a fantastic opportunity and I am proud to be leading a team now. I hope that my story will encourage other women and young girls to make mining a career option for them. Women not only survive in mining but we can also thrive if we are given the opportunity to do so. I believe that perseverance is the mother of all hope. I still have many milestones and goals that I want to achieve to become a Mine Captain and then someday to be a Mine Manager,” she concludes.
