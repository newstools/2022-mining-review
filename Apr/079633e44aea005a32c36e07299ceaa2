All Star has announced that it intends to change its name to Marula Mining. The directors believe that the change of name better reflects the Company’s updated strategic objectives and increased focus on delivering on its strategy of investing in, and developing, mining assets, as reflected in the recent signing of a Heads of Agreement to invest in two mining projects in Zambia and South Africa. The proposed change of name, in order to take effect, requires shareholders to pass a special resolution at a general meeting of the Company. A circular will be sent to shareholders in due course to convene a general meeting of shareholders to vote on the Company’s proposed change of name. Jason Brewer, CEO, commented: “The change of name to Marula Mining supports the Company’s updated strategy, focus on the investment in, and development of, mining assets. The coming months will be very much a period of delivery, and I am excited about the future of the Company. “The Marula Tree is one of the largest indigenous trees and is found throughout Africa and is known as the “King of African Trees”. “The proposed change of name and signing of the Heads of Agreement marks a new chapter for the Company and I look forward to delivering regular and positive updates on the Company’s progress, whilst rapidly developing the advanced projects in Zambia and South Africa and continuing to evaluate other investment opportunities.”
