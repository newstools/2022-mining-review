MC Mining has announced the completion of a BFS for its fully licenced Makhado hard coking coal project. The BFS was prepared by Minxcon, an independent mining industry consulting firm, and is a key milestone in securing the funding for Makhado. The Company expects to finalise the financing for the Makhado Project in Q3 CY2022 with construction commencing soon thereafter. RELATED:IDC extends repayment date for MC Mining The BFS confirmed that Makhado has JORC/SAMREC compliant 296 million mineable tonnes in situ (MTIS) of Measured and Indicated Coal Resources, 7.2 million MTIS of Inferred Coal Resources and 69.3 Mt of Proved and Probable Coal Reserves under the proposed open pit mining and coal processing methods. “The completion of the BFS reflects a key advancement of Makhado and confirms the project’s robust economics. The BFS is based on the project plan with the lowest capital cost options and results in Makhado’s ROM coal being transported to the Vele Colliery for processing for the entire LOM. “The forecast HCC and thermal coal prices used in the BFS were sourced from independent advisors and are considerably lower than current index prices, reflecting Makhado’s robust economics and significant upside. The BFS is a key milestone in securing the funding for Makhado,” explains Sam Randazzo, Interim Chief Executive Officer.
