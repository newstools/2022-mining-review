Newcore Gold has announced drill results from the 90,000 metre drill program underway at the Company’s 100% owned Enchi Gold Project in Ghana. First pass RC drilling at the Tokosea Gold Target, completed as part of the inaugural drill program on the grassroot target at Enchi, intersected multiple wide zones of gold mineralization from surface.

Tokosea is a new greenfield discovery at Enchi where first pass drilling has highlighted the strong potential to delineate additional resources across the 216 km2 land package at Enchi. Luke Alexander, President and CEO of Newcore stated: “These results are the continuation of the results we released last month, confirming and expanding one of three new discoveries at our Enchi Gold Project. These results and new discoveries confirm the potential for Enchi to host additional deposits. “Drilling at Tokosea has successfully delineated high-grade, wide zones of mineralization near surface with drilling on the target having only tested mineralization to an average vertical depth of 75 metres. “We have now defined mineralization across a strike length of four-kilometres, with only a small portion of this six-kilometre-long anomaly tested to date. Enchi’s 216 km2 land package covers 40 kilometres of Ghana’s prolific Bibiani Shear Zone, a gold belt which hosts several large, multi-million-ounce gold deposits. “We look forward to continuing our systematic approach to exploration and defining the potential of our district scale Enchi Gold Project through the drill bit.”
