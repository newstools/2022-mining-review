Perseus Mining has reported further strong results from exploration drilling at its Yaouré Gold Mine in Côte d’Ivoire. Perseus will use the results to upgrade the CMA Underground Inferred Mineral Resource estimate to the Indicated category and complete a PFS for a Yaouré underground mining operation in the June 2022 Quarter.
