Pan African, the South African gold producer, has announced the initiation of phase one of a share buyback programme to purchase up to ZAR 50 million of ordinary shares of £0.01 each in the Company over one month, commencing on 1 April 2022. The Board of Pan African believes that at the current price, the Company’s shares offersignificant value given the quality and profitability of its existing operations and growth projects. The Board has therefore taken the decision to implement a share buyback programme as part of the Company’s broader strategy to deliver value to its shareholders. Cobus Loots, CEO of Pan African commented: “The Company has a demonstrable track record of circumspect capital allocation and this share buyback is compelling in its returns for shareholders, given the prevailing share price. Although it’s a small initial buyback, it signals that the company is prepared to consider share buyback as a means of retuning capital to shareholders, when it is commercial to do so.”
