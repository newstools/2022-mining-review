Lucapa Diamond Company and its partners in the Projecto Lulo JV have advised that construction of crushing circuit of the standalone kimberlite bulk sampling plant on the prolific Lulo concession in Angola has been completed. The full standalone plant is scheduled for completion and commissioning this quarter, after which, the Project Lulo JV partners will be expediting and processing the kimberlite bulk samples at a significantly higher rate of approximately four kimberlite bulk samples per quarter. The key objective of this kimberlite bulk sampling program is to identify the primary source pipe(s) of the exceptional large and high-value diamonds being recovered in the alluvial mining operations and to assist in a preliminary economic assessment of the potential source discoveries. Managing Director Stephen Wetherall said, “With the injection of additional funding into the exploration program post the pandemic impact on progress, the advanced Lulo kimberlite exploration program will now deliver kimberlite bulk sampling results on a very regular basis. The partners look forward to furthering our work on the priority kimberlites and to identifying potentially economic sources.”
