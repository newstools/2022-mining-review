Lotus Resources has announced the results of the reverse circulation (RC) drilling program at its Livingstonia prospect, located approximately 90km from the Kayelekera uranium mine in Malawi. Whilst not part of the current Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS), Livingstonia has the potential to become a satellite deposit in the future. Keith Bowes, Managing Director of Lotus, commented: “The acquisition of the Livingstonia prospect last year consolidated the Company’s ownership of our southern project area, a known uranium mineralised district that has had very limited exploration work completed over the years. RELATED:Mining and exploration licenses renewed at Kayelekera “The strategy at Livingstonia has been to complete a small drilling program to confirm historical results and test extensions around the known mineralised area in order to enable preparation of a JORC (2012) compliant Mineral Resource estimate. We believe the drilling has been successful and an updated Mineral Resource estimate is now planned for completion in the June quarter. “Whilst Livingstonia is not included in the current Definitive Feasibility Study, we believe there is potential for it to become a satellite operation in the future once the Kayelekera resource has been depleted, especially if similar success with ore sorting can be achieved.”
