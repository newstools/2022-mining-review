Botswana Diamonds has announced the results of a conceptual open pit mine optimisation evaluation on the River Blow on its Thorny River property in South Africa. Highlights: Managing Director, James Campbell commented: “The purpose of this exercise was to determine whether there was commercial potential in the Thorny River discoveries. The conceptual open pit evaluation shows that even at low revenue factors the kimberlite is potentially commercial when applying current industry standard mining and processing costs. This exercise will be updated following drilling on the adjacent high priority targets”. Chairman, John Teeling commented: “The Evaluation shows that there is potential for an open pit mine at Thorny River and that there is the potential for operational positive cash flow even at low levels of diamond recovery. We will continue to work on the project including determining the capital cost. We anticipate that drilling in the coming months will extend mineable kimberlite volume”. @BotswanaDiamond MD @JAHC1 will be presenting on 'The Future of Botswana’s Diamond Resources' at @briefbotswana . pic.twitter.com/MbJv01zHVE Doing my thing in the bush :). pic.twitter.com/ZidP9cpFyu
