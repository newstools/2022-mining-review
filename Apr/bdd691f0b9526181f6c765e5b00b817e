Gemfields has announced the results of an auction of predominantly commercial quality rough emeralds held in Jaipur, India from 15 March to 1 April 2022. The emeralds were extracted by Kagem Mining in Zambia. The proceeds of this auction will be fully repatriated to Kagem in Zambia, with all royalties due to the Government of the Republic of Zambia being paid on the full sales prices achieved at the auction. The auction saw 56 companies placing bids, generating record revenues of US$42.3 million with an overall average value of US$9.37 per carat, also a record for Kagem commercial quality auctions. The auction saw 100% of the offered carats and number of lots being sold. Adrian Banks, Gemfields’ MD of Product & Sales, commented: “Our most recent auction represents one of the most momentous outcomes I’ve experienced in my 23-year career. We’ve witnessed another breakthrough for Kagem emeralds, with an auction of predominantly commercial quality emeralds setting a new all-time revenue record for Kagem and surpassing even our higher-quality auctions. “When we announced Kagem’s August 2021 auction results, we pointed to a step-change in market demand and in the prices bid by our customers, paving the way for an exhilarating cycle in the coloured gemstone sector. Today’s result underscores just how big that step change is, and we’re delighted to see the coloured gemstone industry firing on all cylinders.” Highlights
