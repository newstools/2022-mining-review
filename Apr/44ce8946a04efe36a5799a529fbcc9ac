Normet recently launched its new battery-electric personnel carrier for safer underground transportation. The new Utimec MF 205 PER SD sets a new standard for safety, comfort, and ergonomics. People working underground spend hundreds of hours annually in transportation vehicles, with safety and ergonomics standards not always at desirable levels. Normet developed the fully FOPS and ROPS approved Utimec MF 205 PER SD with Normet SmartDrive architecture. The carrier has room for the driver and two passengers in the cabin and for 20 people in the personnel compartment. Normet SmartDrive architecture includes the latest Li-ion battery technology with fast-charging capability. High-torque electric motors provide instant torque and efficient operation without any local emissions. SmartDrive equipment enables higher productivity, lower operating costs and – most importantly zero local emissions. In addition, it generates significantly less noise and heat compared to diesel equivalents, which further improves the operators’ health and safety underground. SmartDrive architecture’s benefits combine with modern suspension and comfortable seats, which reduce vibrations, providing a more comfortable ride for mine workers. Enhancing quality and efficiency SmartDrive’s offering consists of applications for underground logistics and transportation, explosives charging, lifting and installations and concrete spraying. Normet has gained comprehensive experience in battery electric technology through field tests and its extensive global customer network. The company’s latest technologies also include Normet SmartScan, a system for convenient determination and monitoring of applied sprayed concrete layer thickness. It uses state-of-the-art scanning technology and is designed for the harsh underground environment in mining operations. The required concrete layer thickness is achieved quickly and before the concrete spraying machine is moved, thus preventing the need to come back and re-spray the area. This increases efficiency massively while maintaining quality and at the same time reducing the waste of material. An additional feature, SmartScan Align, allows the migration of the profile data from the SmartScan’s local coordinate system into any coordinate system used in surveying. SmartScan and SmartScan Align reduce costly over spraying and ensure efficient and easy data capturing. Both systems are available for all new Normet sprayers and as retrofit kits for existing sprayer fleets. The company’ latest in sprayed concrete technologies include the SmartSpray automatic spray boom control system. Normet offers three different versions of SmartSpray with different automation levels. With SmartSpray Lite, instead of controlling all the spraying boom joints individually, the operator guides the spray nozzle with only one joystick. The SmartSpray Pro version includes automatic sequences, such as point[1]to-point spraying, which makes some standard spraying tasks even easier and more ergonomic. Lastly, the SmartSpray ProPlus version includes automatic sequences, such as automatic spraying of a defined area, which is the first step towards fully automated concrete spraying.
