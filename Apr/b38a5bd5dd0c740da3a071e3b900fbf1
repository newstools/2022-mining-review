Perseus’s three operating gold mines, Yaouré and Sissingué in Côte d’Ivoire, and Edikan in Ghana have combined to produce a total of 130,523 ounces of gold in the March 2022 quarter, 2% more than in the prior quarter. The weighted average production cost incurred during the quarter was US$789 per ounce, while the weighted average AISC was US$908 per ounce of gold. Both production costs and AISCs were 4% and 3% lower respectively the previous quarter. No change has been made to either production or cost guidance for the June 2022 Half Year of 230,000 to 265,000 ounces of gold produced at an AISC of US$915 to 1,085 per ounce. On a year-to-date basis, gold production at our three mines totals 371,687 ounces of gold, produced at a weighted average AISC of US$934 per ounce. No change has been made to either production or cost guidance for the 2022 Financial Year of 471,164- 506,164 ounces of gold produced at an AISC of US$932 to 1,020 per ounce. Yaouré gold mine, Côte d’Ivoire During the quarter, Yaouré, increased its gold production by a further 2% compared to the prior quarter to 76,921 ounces of gold at a production cost of US$549 per ounce and an AISC of US$662 per ounce. The weighted average sales price of the 74,947 ounces of gold sold during the quarter was US$1,720 per ounce, giving rise to a cash margin of US$1,058 per ounce. Notional operating cashflow generated by Yaouré was US$81 million during the quarter, US$6 million more than in the December 2021 quarter. The improving operating performance at Yaouré was a result of improving mill throughput rates (507 tph compared to 487 tph) and run time of 94% compared to 88% during the prior quarter. Gold recovery rates (93.5% compared to 93.6%) and head grade of processed ore (2.50 g/t to 2.64 g/t) were reasonably steady and in line with expectations. In terms of the 5% reduction in quarter-on-quarter AISCs, the increase in gold production and a decrease in G&A costs were the main contributors to the 7% reduction in production costs. A slight decrease in royalties due to the timing of sales was offset by a US$5per ounce increase in sustaining capital costs related to costs associated with the tailings’ storage facility and other site building works. Overall, AISCs were US$38 per ounce lower than the prior quarter. Sissingué gold mine, Côte d’Ivoire During the quarter, 15,012 ounces of gold were produced at Sissingué at a production cost of US$958 per ounce and an AISC of US$1,067 per ounce. The weighted average sales price of the 16,264 ounces of gold sold during the quarter was US$1,683 per ounce, giving rise to a cash margin of US$616 per ounce. Notional cashflow generated from the Sissingué operation totalled US$9.3 million for the quarter, US$ 3.9 million less than in the prior quarter. The quarter-on-quarter decrease in gold production of 3,053 ounces was driven by the decrease in head grade during the quarter from 1.67g/t to 1.36g/t. The impact of this expected fall in head grade was offset to a degree by improved run time (97%), and higher mill throughput rates (189tph) while recoveries remained stable at 89.8%. The 18% or US$152 per ounce increase in quarter-on-quarter AISCs, was primarily a function of the 17% increase in production costs solely attributed to the 17% decrease in the ounces of gold produced during the quarter as explained above. A slight increase in royalties due to the higher gold sales price was largely offset by a decrease in sustaining capital costs. An updated Life of Mine Plan for the Sissingué operation that involved the mining and processing of ore from each of the Sissingué, Fimbiasso and the yet to be granted, Bagoé exploitation permit areas, was finalised during the quarter (refer to news release ‘Perseus Mining updates Life of Mine Plan for Sissingué Gold Mine & Satellite Deposits’ dated 28 March 2022), with the following key results: Edikan gold mine, Ghana In the March 2022 quarter, Perseus produced 38,590 ounces of gold at Edikan (10% more than in the December quarter) at a production cost of US$1,202 per ounce and an AISC of US$1,336 per ounce, 9% and 8% respectively lower than in the prior quarter. Gold sales of 39,833 ounces were 16% more than in the prior quarter, at a weighted average realised gold price of US$1,673 per ounce, US$60 per ounce more than in the prior quarter. This generated a cash margin of US$337 per ounce, a 107% improvement on the prior quarter. Notional cashflow of US$13.0 million, was US$6.3 million better than in the prior period. While the overall performance of Edikan was better in the March 2022 quarter than in the December 2021 quarter, further improvement is expected as mining moves to below previously cutback areas in the AG Pit. Results achieved in March and to date in the June 2022 quarter validate this expectation. In the March 2022 quarter, the primary driver of production improvement was an increase in milled head grade. This averaged 0.87g/t compared to 0.73 g/t in the prior quarter. Other critical operating parameters such as run time, throughput rate and recovery were all relatively unchanged compared to the prior quarter. While the head grade did improve relative to the prior quarter, it fell short of Perseus’s expectation largely due to lower than planned material movements by our mining contractor which necessitated continued feed from low grade stockpile to supplement mill feed from the AG Pit. This situation is steadily improving although our contractor continues to struggle with equipment availability due to supply chain challenges resulting in shortages of spare parts from OEM suppliers. The 8% or US$114 per ounce decrease in quarter-on-quarter AISCs achieved by Edikan, was a function of the 9% decrease in production costs reflecting the 10% increase in the ounces of gold produced during the quarter as explained above. A slight increase in royalties due to the higher gold sales price slightly offset the decrease in production cost while sustaining capital costs were unchanged on a per ounce basis. Offer to acquire Orca Gold During the quarter, Perseus announced that it had entered into an Arrangement Agreement with Orca Gold Inc. to acquire all the outstanding common shares of Orca not already owned by Perseus, by way of a statutory plan of arrangement under the Canada Business Corporations Act.
