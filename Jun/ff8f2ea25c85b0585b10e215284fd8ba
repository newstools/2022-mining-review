The revised Exploration Target, which is additional to the 3 May 2022 MRE, range for additional potential mineralisation at Makuutu has been estimated at; 216 – 535 million tonnes grading 400 – 600 ppm TREO. Ionic Rare Earths Managing Director Tim Harrison commented: “The long-term exploration potential is immense. This updated exploration target, which factors in the successful Phase 3 RAB drilling assay results from July 2021, confirms the massive potential of EL00147, having identified immediate extensions to the resource estimate beyond previous radiometric targeting. Additionally, the new tenement at EL00257 would provide additional upside beyond this target.” Ionic Rare Earths $IXR Managing Director @timhorizonmet  joins @Investinmining Cape Town Conference to discuss the focus and prospective outlook on the Makuutu Rare Earths Project in Uganda.#mining #rareearthoxides #magnets #technology https://t.co/ss0os5Hyi6
