Atlantic Lithium has announced initial assay results from the ongoing resource and exploration drilling programme at the Ewoyaa Lithium Project in Ghana, West Africa. Commenting on the Company’s latest progress, Lennard Kolff, Interim Chief Executive Officer of Atlantic Lithium, said: “We are pleased to report that initial reported assay results from RC drilling at the Grasscutter North target at the Ewoyaa project in Ghana have returned high-grade lithium intersections in a new target area outside of the Resource footprint. These results, being near the currently defined Resource, give us confidence to deliver future resource upgrades for the project. “Drilling at the Ewoyaa project is ongoing, with only approximately 15,000 m of the planned 37,000 m programme completed to date. Assays for the ongoing resource evaluation and exploration drilling are still pending, with the programme targeted to complete in Q3,2022. “Our ongoing exploration activities demonstrate considerable opportunities for resource growth, the improvement of Project metrics significantly beyond the current defined mine life, and for further economic benefits due to increases in spodumene concentrate pricing, which have far exceeded our initial internally forecasted SC6 price modelling parameters. These fundamentals continue to demonstrate Ewoyaa as an industry-leading asset. “With the Pre-Feasibility Study, targeted for completion in Q3 2022, and the project being funded to production through our agreement with Piedmont Lithium, we feel the Company is ideally positioned to benefit from the growing lithium demand.” Highlights: o          GRC0647: 22 m at 1.25% Li2O from 104 m o          GRC0646: 15 m at 1.35% Li2O from 71 m o          GRC0642: 13 m at 1.26% Li2O from 185 m o          GRC0636: 9m at 1.24% Li2O from 131 m o          GRC0649: 9m at 1.09% Li2O from 182 m
