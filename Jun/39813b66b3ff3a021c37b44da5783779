During the week commencing 6 June 2022, several attacks attributed to insurgent activity occurred in the vicinity of Ancuabe, a town in the Cabo Delgado province of Mozambique. Ancuabe lies approximately 65 km east-north-east of MRM. As such, these attacks are considerably closer to the operations of Montepuez Ruby Mining Limitada (MRM), in which Gemfields holds a 75% interest. Most of the earlier insurgent activity has occurred more than 150 km to the north-east of MRM. The incidents are reported as having occurred between 15 km and 40 km north ofthe N1 and N14 roads, the principal route used by MRM to travel to and from the coastal town of Pemba, the provincial capital. At the time of writing, military escorts are accompanying civilian vehicles on the stretch of road closer to Pemba. Last week’s attacks reportedly included the killing of two employees of the Ancuabe Graphite Project owned by Grafex Limitada, a subsidiary of Australian company Triton Minerals. While MRM has implemented certain travel restrictions, its mining and processing operations remain unaffected. Gemfields and MRM hold the health and safety of their employees and contractors as their highest priority. The group remains in regular contact with government authorities and is closely monitoring developments.
