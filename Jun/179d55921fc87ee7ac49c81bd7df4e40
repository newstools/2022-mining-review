Harmony Gold Mining Company has announced that key regulatory approvals were obtained to allow the Company to proceed with its Kareerand expansion project to ensure the continued retreatment of surface depositions at Mine Waste Solutions. Mine Waste Solutions was acquired by Harmony in October 2020. It is a reclamation operation in the Stilfontein/Orkney area in the North West province in South Africa. It treats 2.2 Mt per month from historical tailings facilities through the Mine Waste Solution plant.

The Kareerand Expansion Project is expected to produce approximately 100 000 oz of gold per annum and add 16 years’ life of mine at an estimated all-in sustaining cost of about R572 000/kg over the life of the mine – lowering the risk profile of Harmony’s asset portfolio and improving its margin as a result. “The Kareerand Expansion Project is yet another example of “Mining with Purpose. “This low risk, low-cost operation will ensure healthy returns for investors, the creation of jobs for another 16 years and the rehabilitation and restoration of land in the area,” says Peter Steenkamp, Harmony’s CEO.
