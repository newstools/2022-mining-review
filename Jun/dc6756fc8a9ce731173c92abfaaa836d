When a sports team does not fare well, all fingers are pointed at the manager or coach. And more often that not, he gets the boot. Subsequently, someone else comes in and tries to turn the team’s fortunes around. Now, let’s look at this analogy in the context of the mess at Eskom that has resulted in Stage 6 rolling blackouts this week, something last experienced in December 2019. There are number of reasons that are well documented in the media as to why Eskom cannot keep the lights on, ranging from a wildcat strike to units breaking down – whatever it is the country has been plunged into darkness for hours at a time, frustrating its citizens and having a negative impact on the economy. RELATED:Mining can contribute to energy transition says Gwede Mantashe In the sporting context, Eskom is the team and its captain is CEO Andre De Ruyter. The manager is a man who has not said much about the power crisis in recent days. That man is Gwede Mantashe. There is no doubt that when he was appointed, Mantashe was well received by both the mining and energy sectors. He was instrumental in bringing industry and government together for what we hoped would be for the benefit of the country. However, over the last few years, it seems as though his promises to solve our energy woes have been nothing more than soapbox rhetoric. As such, he must bear a large part of the responsibility for Eskom’s failings. If Mantashe was the manager of a sports team, he would surely have received his marching orders by now. Perhaps its time that this happens and his replacement will help us see the light at the end of a very long and dark tunnel.
