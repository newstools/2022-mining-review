Southern Palladium has announced results of a high-definition, helicopter-borne TMF gradient and gamma-ray spectrometry survey at the Bengwenyama platinum group metals (PGMs) project. The TMF survey was carried out with the following dual aim: The Company confirms that TMF data supports and enhances previous structural modelling, which formed the framework of the existing JORC 2012-compliant Inferred Mineral Resource of 18.8Moz (3PGE + Gold), situated within the UG2 and Merensky Reefs. In addition, imaging shows that there are almost no anomalous magnetic features which would indicate large areas of potential loss-of-ground geological features in the eastern part of Eerstegeluk, where the phase 1 drilling is planned. Anomalies observed over the phase 2 portion have been interpreted to be shallow and above the reef in the far southwest corner and is not expected to impact our target ounces. Commenting on Southern Palladium’s dual-listing and exploration plans, MD Johan Odendaal, said: “We are pleased to present the results of a detailed Total Magnetic Field (TMF) survey at Bengwenyama. The central aim of the survey – to confirm the structural integrity of the Inferred mineral resource, and investigate any potential loss-of-ground disruptions – were both achieved. “We can now commence the Phase 1 drilling programme with the appropriate degree of confidence around the mineralised structure of the drill site. “With the appointment of Geomech as the drill contractor, mobilisation in collaboration with our host community is underway and we expect to commence drilling operations by July 2022.” Key highlights: • High-definition helicopter-borne Total Magnetic Field (TMF) gradient and gamma-ray spectrometry survey completed at the Bengwenyama Project• TMF data confirms previous structural model of the UG2 and Merensky Reefs, which forms the framework of the Inferred Mineral Resource 18.8Moz (3PGE+Gold)• Imaging also confirms absence of anomalous (Loss of Reef) features in the target area for phase 1 drill programme• Confirmation underpins confidence in the existing geological structure of the reef upon which the Phase 1 drilling programme has been planned• A contract has been signed with Geomech Africa Proprietary (Geomech) for the Phase 1 drilling programme, which is scheduled to commence early July
