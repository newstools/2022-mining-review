Atlantic Lithium has announced positive metallurgical test-work results in support of the PFS underway for the Ewoyaa Lithium Project in Ghana, West Africa. Commenting on the Company’s latest progress, Lennard Kolff, Interim Chief Executive Officer of Atlantic Lithium, said: “Results have successfully demonstrated that we are able to produce high-purity, low contaminants 6% Li2O SC6 spodumene concentrate at a coarse 10 mm crush, which is much coarser than previously projected in the Scoping Study, providing potential for lower operating costs; especially within the dominant P1 material. “Results have consistently delivered lithium and feldspar concentrate quality that exceeds off-taker requirements and reaffirms the suitability of a simple dense medium gravity separation process route, boding well for low capital costs, operating costs and carbon intensities. “Results of the metallurgical test-work programme are a key deliverable in support of the Pre-Feasibility Study, targeted for completion in Q3,2022. “The Project is exceptionally well located, being only 1km from the sealed national highway and 110 km from the operating deep-sea port of Takoradi with adjacent grid power; we believe it is challenging to find better located lithium pegmatite projects elsewhere. “With Ewoyaa being funded to production through our agreement with Piedmont Lithium, these metallurgical results continue to highlight the exceptional potential of the Project and the value that it brings to the Company and our shareholders.”
