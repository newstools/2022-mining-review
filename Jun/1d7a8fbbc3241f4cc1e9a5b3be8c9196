Implats’ operating subsidiaries – Impala Platinum’s Rustenburg operations and Marula Platinum – have signed an historic five-year wage settlement with the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU). The settlement is effective from 1 July 2022, and assures employees of increases to all major components of remuneration over the next five years including basic salaries, living-out and home-ownership allowances, medical aid and pension fund contributions. The agreement is in line with current mining inflation of c.6.5% and considers the reality of sustained inflationary pressures faced by our employees. This agreement secures five years of stability at Implats’ operating entities and has been achieved through a collaborative process typified by mutual respect and consideration and without requiring intervention or mediation by third parties. The agreement removes substantial uncertainty for our employees and allows a singular focus on the pursuit of safe and sustainable production.
