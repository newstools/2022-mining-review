Sibanye-Stillwater has signed a three-year wage agreement for its SA gold operations, effective from 1 July 2022. The lockout has been lifted for members of trade unions, the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU) and the National Union of Mine Workers (NUM). In a recent statement, Sibanye Stillwater said that the signed wage agreement is in line with management’s attempts to achieve an inflation-related increase with this agreement resulting in an average 6.3% increase over a three-year period. While this is long-awaited progress for miners, the lockout lift seems to be a pyrrhic victory for the unions. Workers have been on lockout for nearly 3 months, with the peril of no income. “Miners, Artisans and Officials will receive an average increase of 5% in year 1; *5.5% (in year 2; and 5% in year 3 If CPI is greater than 5.5%. then the increase will be 5.5%, if CPI is less than 5% then the increase will be 5%, or if CPI is between 5% and 5.5% then the increase will be the same as CPI.” the statement read. “We look forward to restarting our South African gold operations for the benefit of all stakeholders. We thank the CCMA for the mediation role which resulted in a fair outcome to all stakeholders.  We are pleased to have achieved an agreement which is in line with inflation and which will contribute significantly to the sustainability of our gold operations.” Neal Froneman Group CEO commented. #SibanyeStillWater 3 months strike over.
