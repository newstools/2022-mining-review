Fortuna Silver Mines has provided an update of its Sunbird exploration program at the Séguéla gold Project located in Côte d’Ivoire. Paul Weedon, Senior Vice President of Exploration, commented: “Following the release of Sunbird´s maiden Inferred Mineral Resource containing 350,000 gold ounces in March 2022, expansion drilling has continued to grow the high grade mineralized footprint at depth and beyond the initial maiden resource envelope.” Mr. Weedon continued: “Results such as 28.2 g/t gold over 3.5 meters from drill hole SGRD1408 and 12.6 g/t gold over 7.7 meters from drill hole SGRD1422 highlight the open nature of the deposit´s mineralization.” Mr. Weedon added, “Further drilling is underway to test these extensions, with drill hole SGRD1423, a further 100 meters down plunge, intersecting several points of visible gold.” RELATED:Fortuna Silver Mines: New name in West Africa, but not for longFortuna Silver Mines’ Séguéla advancing ahead of scheduleFortuna reports net income of US$27.0 million Q2,2022 “In addition to the exploration success at Sunbird this field season, target generation elsewhere on the Séguéla property has continued to grow the portfolio with several new very encouraging prospects identified.” Sunbird Prospect drill highlights include: • SGRD1405: 18.3 g/t gold over an estimated true width of 11.9 meters from 168 meters• SGRD1408: 28.2 g/t gold over an estimated true width of 3.5 meters from 351 meters• SGRD1421: 6.1 g/t gold over an estimated true width of 8.4 meters from 252 meters• SGRD1422: 12.6 g/t gold over an estimated true width of 7.7 meters from 319 meters
