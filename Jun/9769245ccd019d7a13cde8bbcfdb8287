Sibanye-Stillwater has announced a significant flood event, which has affected a widespread region surrounding its US PGM operations in Montana USA. The flooding of numerous rivers in the region, follows a warm spell leading to a rapid melt of accumulated snow in the mountains and associated runoff, which was exacerbated by heavy rainfall. No injuries have been reported and all employees at the operation are reported safe.The road between Nye and the Stillwater mine has been eroded and several bridges in the region damaged. This is likely to restrict access to the Stillwater mine forsome period that will be better known in the next few days. In a recent statement sent to update its stakeholders, Sibanye said “A number of employees are at the Stillwater Mine site to maintain the integrity of the mine, and to provide refuge and support for campers that are arriving from thenearby Woodbine campground. We will continue to support efforts to ensure the safety of all those at Woodbine and the surrounding area.” New details coming in from Park County as Livingston residents say this could be the worst flooding they've ever seen. https://t.co/uDGJJAehYb The East Boulder mine is less affected and access currently remains intact.The miner says that a full assessment of the regional impact of the floods and the impact on the operations will be undertaken once the floodwaters have subsided. “Sibanye-Stillwater will be on hand to support ongoing rescue efforts and our thoughts and prayers are with our communities and our local emergency responders as theyall work on this challenging situation.” the statement read.
