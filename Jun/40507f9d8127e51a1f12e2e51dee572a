Aim-listed AfriTin Mining has announced promising initial results for its lithium and tantalum drilling programme at the company’s flagship operation, the Uis Mine in Namibia. The infill drilling programme is being conducted at the main V1/V2 pegmatite at Uis, which is currently being mined to extract tin, with a view to increasing the confidence of the existing lithium and tantalum estimates for the deposit. The programme consists of approximately 50 planned holes; drilling for 27 holes has been completed. Highlights: Related: Does Uis have another ace up its sleeve? Anthony Viljoen (CEO) commented, “We are very pleased to announce these drilling results which have produced lithium grades surpassing our expectations and reinforce our belief that Uis is host to one of the largest lithium resources globally. While the V1/V2 pegmatite displays impressive dimensions and is open-ended at depth, a multitude of surrounding pegmatites present significant upside potential. “As a former mining operation, Uis has been extensively drilled but historic assaying has focused solely on the tin with no regard for the lithium or tantalum in the deposit. This programme will increase the confidence of the current lithium and tantalum estimates and is part of our strategy to bring these two commodities into production alongside our tin operation. “Our recently released preliminary economic assessment for the Phase 2 Project in April highlighted the economic potential of these by-product elements which are game changing. The construction of a new lithium pilot plant will allow us to progress to commercial production phases much faster than a new greenfield lithium resource elsewhere.”
