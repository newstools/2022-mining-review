“The final quarter delivered what was a highly successful 2021, resulting in Centamin delivering annual gold production and costs at the midpoint of our guidance. 2021 has been characterised by solid delivery against our stated plans and completion of the Sukari Life of Asset study, confirming the high-quality and long life of the mine, in addition to identifying significant upside growth opportunities,” comments CEO, Martin Horgan. “Excellent progress was made against our key capital projects as we continue to invest in the future of our assets. We continued to improve our safety performance, beating our annual targets, as we strive to achieve a zero-harm workplace. “We have commenced 2022 with confidence and excitement and look forward to delivering on our clear roadmap to growing and unlocking further value from Sukari and our exploration portfolio, as outlined at the capital markets event on 8 December 2021.” Total material moved (waste and ore) of 30.4 Mt (FY: 110.2 Mt), a 43% increase YoY, driven by scheduled increased material movement and improved operating efficiencies and productivities. Total open pit waste material mined for the quarter was 27.7 Mt (FY: 97.8 Mt), a 56% increase YoY, driven by the successful execution of the accelerated waste-stripping programme, improving the long-term flexibility and stability of the open pit. The strip ratio for the quarter was 10.3:1 (waste:ore) (FY: 7.9:1). Open pit ore mining in Q4 continued to focus on the Stage 5 North and Stage 4 West areas. Total open pit ore mined for the quarter was 2.7 Mt (FY: 12.4 Mt), a 24% reduction YoY, at an average mined grade of 0.93 grams of gold per tonne (“g/t Au”) (FY: 0.86 g/t Au), a 26% improvement YoY, driven by scheduled higher grades delivered from Stage 4 West. Total material mined (waste and ore) was 205 kt (FY: 1.1 Mt), a 29% reduction YoY. Total ore mined was 145 kt (FY: 739 kt) at an average combined (stoping and development) grade of 4.97g/t Au (FY: 4.95 g/t). This represented a 12% reduction in ore tonnes YoY and a 36% improvement in grade YoY. Tonnes mined were below schedule due to issues driven by contractor staffing levels impacted by COVID-19 travel restrictions. This was partially offset by improved mining flexibility resulting in better than scheduled mined grades. The underground ore split was 86kt of ore mined from stopes, at an average grade of 6.46g/t Au, and 59kt of ore mined from development, at an average grade of 2.79g/t Au. The Company is on track to complete an assessment of the underground operating model imminently, including an independent contractor-mining tender process. The independently run process involved assessing several competitive contractor proposals and a cost-risk benefit analysis of both contractor-mining and owner-operator mining the underground operations. The plant processed 3.2Mt of ore (FY: 11.9 Mt), a 10% increase YoY, at an average feed grade of 1.11 g/t Au (FY: 1.18 g/t), a 29% improvement YoY. The metallurgical gold recovery rate was 87.0% for the quarter (FY:88.6%), a 2% reduction YoY, reflecting mill feed contribution from low-grade stockpiles in the quarter. The focus on improving processing productivity and efficiencies through the plant upgrades resulted in better than scheduled annualised 2021 metallurgical recoveries. During the quarter, the low-grade stockpiles were drawn down from 18.9 Mt to 18.6 Mt at 0.46g/t Au. Total capex in Q4 was US$86 million (FY: US$233m), which was an 80% increase YoY. Excellent progress was made in the quarter on key capital projects. The tailing storage facilities (TSF1 and TSF2), underground development and the waste stripping programmes were progressed ahead of schedule. The project development and construction of the solar project and paste fill plan both remained largely on track and scheduled for commissioning in Q3 and Q4 2022respectively although the slight delays in spend have resulted in US$25 million of capex deferred from 2021 to 2022. Solar project activities completed in the quarter included foundations for the battery storage facility, MV cable installation for the solar panel network and trenching for the LV cable installation. The paste fill plant earthworks were completed in the quarter. In Q4, surface exploration on the 160km2 Sukari Mining Concession commenced with a prioritised 10,000 m drilling programme, targeting potential satellite deposits to the Sukari processing facility. The programme is near completion and assay results are expected in Q1 2022. Gold sales for the quarter were 99,936 oz (FY: 407,252 oz), a 26% improvement YoY. The average realised gold price for the quarter was US$1,828/oz (FY: US$1,797/oz), down 3% YoY. Revenues generated of US$183 million (FY: US$733 million), increased by 22% YoY, driven by higher gold sales and marginally offset by lower realised gold price. At the end of the quarter, there was US$20 million gold bullion on hand due to the shipment of the final pour being after 31 December 2021. Total cash costs of production were US$104.6 million for the quarter (FY: US$356.9 million), a 42% increase YoY, with lower underground costs partially offsetting higher fuel prices and increased open pit costs due to more material moved. Unit cash costs of production were US$972/oz produced (FY: US$859/oz), a 10% reduction YoY. Total AISC were US$125.5 million for the quarter (FY: US$493.1 million), a 2% reduction in YoY, as the open pit contractor waste-stripping programme outperformed. Unit AISC of US$1,256/oz sold (FY: US$1,211/oz), a 22% reduction in YoY costs, reflecting lower costs complimented by higher gold sales. Total exploration expensed in Q4 was US$6.4 million, a 170% increase YoY, including the below key activities:
