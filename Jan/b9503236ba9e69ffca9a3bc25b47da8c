Emmerson has announced the award of the balance of the Basic Engineering scope of the Khemisset Potash Project outside of the Mineral Processing Facility to Reminex, the engineering arm of the Moroccan mining company Managem Group. Graham Clarke, CEO, commented: “The award of the balance of the Basic Engineering comes because of a thorough competitive tender process executed by the Project team and enables us to continue towards full EPCM commencement during the year of 2022. “Reminex has extensive experience accrued over decades of operating within the Moroccan mining sector. Its substantial expertise will be vital for adapting our Khemisset Project to the local standards and for the provision of advice and assistance in the remaining permitting and due diligence processes alongside Basic Engineering. “2022 will be a transformative year for the Company as we execute the final workstreams towards construction. We are expecting to make progress concurrently on drilling activities, Basic Engineering, discussions with other potential equity and lending banks, preparations for EPCM execution and finalisation of permitting activities. The Emmerson team look forward to working closely with Reminex to build long-term benefits for the kingdom of Morocco.” Following award of the Basic Engineering package for the Mineral Processing Facility to Barr Engineering in November 2021, the Company has awarded the balance of the Basic Engineering scope to Reminex pursuant to a thorough pre-qualification, competitive tender, and negotiation process. The ability to award the Basic Engineering for the Project has been facilitated by the proceeds from the recent transformational strategic investment by the Singaporean fund Global Sustainable Minerals and Gold Quay Capital. This enables the Company to continue Project development alongside activities pursuant to financial close.
