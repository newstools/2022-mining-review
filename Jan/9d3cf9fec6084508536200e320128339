Eastinco Mining and Exploration has announced a progress update on exploration works at its JV project in southern Rwanda. The geochemical soil sampling programme at the HCK JV license has covered 50% of the license and eleven new pegmatite zones have been identified during field traversing, of which two possibly indicate strike extensions to the existing, known pegmatite zones. Charles Bray, Chairman of Eastinco, stated: “I am very pleased to provide this operational update on the ongoing fieldwork in southern Rwanda. The discovery of these nine new and potentially Tantalum-Niobium bearing zones is very exciting, especially considering we have only covered 50% of the licence area as a first pass. “The possible strike extension to the HCK-1 project is more positive news, and I look forward to updating our shareholders as we continue our work on the ground to build on our knowledge of these targets. “The results so far confirm our original expectation that this area could evolve into an exciting exploration play that will bolster our Rwanda-based asset portfolio, bringing added value to the Company and our shareholders.”
