Atlantic Lithium has announced ongoing high-grade infill drilling results at the Ewoyaa Lithium Project in Ghana, West Africa, where the Company recently announced an updated Scoping Study and increased JORC resource of 21.3 Mt @ 1.31% Li2O, resulting in a significant improvement in project economics and life of mine. Commenting on the company’s latest progress, Vincent Mascolo, CEO of Atlantic, said: “The ongoing infill drilling results received continue to confirm mineralisation grade and continuity where tested across the Ewoyaa deposit. “Assay results received over the Ewoyaa Sill target to date are encouraging, with mineralisation occurring in flat lying sill structures favourable for tonnage addition and low strip ratio. Additional results are still pending. “Visible spodumene was observed in the new Kaampakrom West target, with assays pending. Both of these target areas fall outside of the current resource footprint, indicating the potential for further resource growth. “The Company is targeting >80% resource conversion from inferred to indicated over the recently upgraded 21.3 Mt @ 1.31% Li2O resource, as well as a targeted tonnage increase to over 24 Mt in support of a 12-year mine life for future studies. “Our resource continues to grow, and the upside of the Project is clear. As such, we expect that the Project metrics will improve beyond the current defined Life of Mine. It is estimated by the Company that every additional year of production will add up to c. US$60 million in post-tax NPV per annum. These fundamentals continue to demonstrate Ewoyaa as an industry-leading asset and, with the Company being ideally poised to benefit from the growing lithium market, we look forward to progressing the Project towards production and establishing Atlantic as new player in the lithium supply chain.”
