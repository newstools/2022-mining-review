Red Rock Resources , the natural resource development company focussed on gold, but with developing interests in copper, cobalt, and other minerals, has announced an update on the Red Rock VUP Project. On 14 January 2022 the Commercial Court of Lubumbashi issued an executory judgment ordering VUP SA, the Company’s partner in the Joint Venture, to pay $2,000,000 as damages, with costs. This follows the earlier judgment for payment of a principal amount of $2,505,000, representing 50.1% of the payment already made by a third party to VUP SA. Red Rock Chairman Andrew Bell comments: “These awards in our favour of $4,505,000 plus costs are steps in a process, and do not put this money into our account, nor do they represent the totality of our potential claims. “We now begin to move to the enforcement and extra-judicial phases of proceedings. The Company expects to announce drilling results from another project in the DRC, Luanshimba, within the next days.”
