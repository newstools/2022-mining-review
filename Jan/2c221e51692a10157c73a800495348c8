Sibanye-Stillwater has again been included in the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index (GEI). The Group is one of 418 companies globally, across 45 countries and regions representing a variety of sectors, which qualified to be included in the index. Sibanye-Stillwater was included in this year’s index for scoring at or above a global threshold established by Bloomberg to reflect a high level of disclosure and overall performance across the framework’s five pillars.

CEO, Neal Froneman of Sibanye-Stillwater commented: “We continue to support a future where gender inequality ceases to exist, supported by a culture where high performance, opportunities, and contribution are valued without any bias. “Our commitment is endorsed by our target of ensuring that 30% of our workforce are female by 2025 with simultaneous focus on increasing the representation and development of women at all levels and in all functions.” “We are proud to recognize Sibanye-Stillwater and the other 417 companies included in the 2022 GEI for their commitment to transparency and setting a new standard in gender-related data reporting,” said Peter T. Grauer, Chairman of Bloomberg and Founding Chairman of the U.S. 30% Club. “Even though the threshold for inclusion in the GEI has risen, the member list continues to grow. This is a testament that more companies are working to improve upon their gender related metrics, fostering more opportunity for diverse talent to succeed in their organizations.”
