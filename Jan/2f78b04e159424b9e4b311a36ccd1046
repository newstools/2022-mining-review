“Pan African has again delivered an excellent operational performance, achieving record gold production more than 108,000 oz for the current reporting period,” comments Pan African CEO Cobus Loots: “This exceeded the expected 105,000 oz announced in the Group’s December 2021 production update and was achieved while continuing to manage the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and maintaining an excellent safety record. “The reduction in the Group’s net senior debt to US$23.9 million represents a 60.1% decrease relative to the outstanding net senior debt at 31 December 2020, notwithstanding the payment of a record final Rand dividend for the June 2021 financial year. “Barberton Mines’ gold production of 49,117 oz for the current reporting period decreased by 6.2%, we are however still forecasting that the operation will achieve full year production guidance of approximately 100,000 oz. At Elikhulu, production was down marginally by 3.6% to 25,900 oz, mainly because of inclement weather conditions experienced during November and December 2021. Evander Mines’ 8 Shaft pillar delivered an excellent performance during the current reporting period, demonstrating the potential of this operation. Elevated grades and improved mining rates, because of improved face availability, increased production from the pillar and surface sources by 72.5% to 33,068 oz for the current reporting period. Following the reprioritised capital programme, as announced in the Group’s 2021 results presentation, work continues in preparation for the inception of mining Evander’s 8 Shaft No.2 decline at 24 Level. Mining from this level is anticipated to commence in the 2023 financial year, as the existing pillar mining reaches completion. Studies to access the 25 and 26 Level Mineral Resources at 8 Shaft are also at an advanced stage. Our organic growth projects have the potential to increase Evander’s operating life by an estimated 20 years. The 10 MW solar PV plant at Evander Mines is on track to be commissioned late in February 2022, following delays due to port disruptions and inclement weather. A feasibility study to expand the solar PV plant to 26 MW is underway, with the additional capacity designated for Evander’s underground growth projects, with renewable energy expected to further improve the profitability and sustainability of this operation. At the end of last year, the Group announced the conditional acquisition of one of the last remaining large-scale gold tailings resources available in South Africa, the Blyvoor Gold TSF dumps. This opportunity could further build on the Company’s track record of successfully bringing tailings retreatment operations to fruition. An independent fatal flaw assessment and gap analysis has commenced on the Blyvoor Assets, with this work expected to be completed by April 2022. At Mintails, the DFS on Mogale Gold’s TSFs is being finalised. The Group is on track to produce 200,000 oz of gold for the financial year ending 30 June 2022, and we are committed to continue creating value for our stakeholders by positioning Pan African as a sustainable, safe, high margin and long-life gold producer with an attractive pipeline of growth projects. We look forward to presenting our interim results on 16 February 2022.” New self-generation threshold sparks corporate interest https://t.co/dxn5sQn6GR via @BusinessLiveSA Barberton Mines’ production decreased by 6.2% to 49,117 oz (2020: 52,354 oz) for the current reporting period, consistent with the mine plan. Work during the current reporting period included accelerating the waste development to the new 259 platform in the high-grade Main Reef Complex (MRC) orebody. Underground production decreased by 5.6% to 39,991 oz (2020: 42,350 oz) and the BTRP’s production decreased by 8.8% to 9,126 oz (2020: 10,004 oz) for the current reporting period. Barberton Mines is still on track to deliver approximately 100,000 oz for the year ending 30 June 2022. Gold production from Elikhulu decreased marginally by 3.6% to 25,900 oz (2020: 26,863 oz) during the current reporting period. Production was adversely impacted by inclement weather conditions during November and December 2021. Gold production from Elikhulu is expected to increase in the second half of the 2022 financial year, consistent with the mining plan which, forecasts production of approximately 55,000 oz for the year ending 30 June 2022. Pan African taking steps to acquire Blyvoor Gold surface resources https://t.co/TkQYr8kEto Production from the Evander Mines’ increased by 72.5% to 33,068 oz (2020: 19,169 oz). Underground production increased by 116.6% to 27,312 oz (2020: 12,607 oz). The increase in the 8 Shaft Pillar’s production during the current reporting period was a result of: Gold production from the 8 Shaft Pillar is expected to normalise during the second half of the 2022 financial year because of planned mining in areas with anticipated grades of approximately 8 g/t. Shareholders are referred to the announcement of 15 December 2021, containing the details of the proposed transaction to acquire the Blyvoor Gold’s TSFs. After the announcement, the Group has engaged independent consultants to conduct a fatal flaw assessment and gap analysis as part of the initial due diligence. These studies will be completed by April 2022, consistent with the timelines of the staged acquisition process. During November 2020, the Group announced the conditional acquisition of Mintails’ SA Mogale Gold and the Soweto Cluster’s (MSC) TSFs, with combined Mineral Resources of 243 Mt with an in-situ grade of 0.30 g/t, for an estimated gold content of 2.36 Moz. A PFS was completed on Mogale Gold’s TSFs during July 2021. The MSC TSFs were excluded from the study’s scope as additional technical and due diligence analysis is required, which will be addressed in forthcoming studies. Average production of between 40-50koz/yr over an 11-year LOM was projected by the PFS. Following the positive PFS findings, the Group is currently finalising a DFS, led by DRA Global (DRA), which is scheduled to be completed in Q1 of the 2022 calendar year. A concept study on the Soweto Cluster is also progressing under the auspices of DRA. After the judgement finding that Mintails will remain in provisional liquidation, the Group has engaged with the provisional liquidator to progress the transaction and are working on the finalisation of the DFS.
