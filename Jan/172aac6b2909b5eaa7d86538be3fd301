Bannerman Shareholders – Our CEO @Brandon_Munro is currently working on his 1st shareholder email for 2022.

Importantly, the benefit of that work is enhanced by the high degree of continuity in the DFS team, with seamless involvement from our lead study manager, Wood plc, and many of the key executives that delivered Etango technical studies over the last decade. We remain on-track for completion of the Etango-8 DFS in the September 2022 quarter.”
