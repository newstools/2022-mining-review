RELATED:Fortuna announces positive construction decision for Séguéla Paul Weedon, Senior Vice President of Exploration, commented: “Exploration results at Séguéla continue to support the high-grade trend we have seen from the recent drilling at the Sunbird Prospect, and with all results now to hand, the Company is looking forward to seeing a maiden inferred resource estimate for Sunbird.” Weedon continued, “Mineralization at Sunbird remains open along strike and at depth, where coarse visible gold seen in diamond drill core is supported by high gold assay grades, with the high-grade core extending more than 250 meters in strike length.” Weedon concluded, “Significant upside remains at depth and additional drilling has commenced to test this potential.”
