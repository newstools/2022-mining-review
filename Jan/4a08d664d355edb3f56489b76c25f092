Kasbah Resources has announced that the mining license of the Achmmach tin project, the license d’exploitation No.332912 has been successfully renewed for a further 10-year period to 17 January 2032. The Mining License is held by Atlas Tin SAS, the Company’s 75% owned subsidiary and represents, alongside the ESIA, the critical license to develop and operate the Achmmach Project. The Company has undertaken extensive work on the Achmmach Project since 2008, spending approximately $80 million on over 120,000 m of diamond drilling, engineering, and feasibility studies, permitting, and statutory obligations. The project currently has a Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE) of 22.4 Mt @ 0.7% Sn for contained tin of 156,000 tonnes, making it one of the most significant undeveloped tin projects globally, in one of the most mining friendly jurisdictions. The Company continues to invest heavily in optimising the Achmmach project, further proving its potential to become a world class tin producer. In 2021, the Company undertook further drilling to establish the continuity of tin mineralisation along the entire 1.6 km of the Sidi Addi Trend, a parallel mineralised zone to the main Meknes Trend, where most of the current resource and reserve is currently located. In addition, the Company continues to advance on optimisation initiatives to improve the project’s overall tin output, mine life and capital efficiency. The Company is committed to setting the standard for a large-scale tin project with high ESG credentials and continues to undertake work streams in pursuit of minimising the project’s environmental footprint. The renewal of the Mining License demonstrates the continued support of the local and regional governments of Morocco and enables the Company to focus on implementing its planned 2022 work program whilst also evaluating other strategic and funding opportunities.
