Alphamin Resources has announced the following update for the quarter ended December 2021: Contained tin production of 3,114 tons is 10% above the previous quarter. Improved underground mining practices relating to stope planning, delineation and blasting resulted in better grade control with an average tin grade of 3,8% processed during the five months ended December 2021. Waste development is now well ahead of current mining areas providing flexibility in blending high- and low-grade areas for a more consistent grade profile. Contained tin sales of 3,056 tons increased 13% from the prior quarter. EBITDA guidance of US$74 million for Q4,2021 is estimated to be 38% higher than the actual EBITDA for the previous quarter of US$53,7 million because of increased tin production and sales volumes, together with a higher average tin price achieved of US$38,084/t (Current tin price: ~US$39,000/t). Alphamin’s vision is to become one of the world’s largest sustainable tin producers. From a capital allocation perspective, the Board considers the combination of significant exploration, investment in growth and a high dividend yield a robust value proposition. Dividend distributions will be considered based on excess free cash after taking account of working capital requirements, reserve contingencies and expansion opportunities. On this basis, the Board resolved to declare a FY2021 CAD$0.03 per share cash dividend on the common shares. The Dividend will be payable on 11 February 2022 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on 4 February, 2022.
