Atlantic Lithium, the funded African-focussed lithium exploration and development company targeting to deliver Ghana’s first lithium mine, has announced additional assay results from the ongoing resource and exploration drilling programme at the Ewoyaa Lithium Project in Ghana, West Africa. Commenting on the Company’s latest progress, Lennard Kolff, Interim CEO of Atlantic Lithium, said: “We are pleased to report ongoing and significant high-grade pegmatite intervals over broad widths below the Ewoyaa Main deposit and outside of the currently defined resource volume, giving us confidence to deliver future resource upgrades for the Project. “Remaining assays are pending for holes GRC0666 and GRC0667 which have long intervals of visible spodumene reported and initial high-grade results received of 10m at 1.39% Li2O in GRC0666 with mineralisation open at depth. “Drilling at the Ewoyaa project is ongoing, with approximately 24,900m of the planned 37,000m programme completed to date, with further assays pending and the programme targeted for completion this quarter. “Our ongoing exploration programme demonstrates considerable scope for resource growth and the potential for an extended mine life beyond the metrics of the Scoping Study. This, in conjunction with further economic benefits from increased spodumene concentrate pricing, continue to demonstrate Ewoyaa as an industry-leading asset. “With the PFS targeted for completion in Q3 2022, and the Project being funded to production through our agreement with Piedmont Lithium, we feel the Company is ideally positioned to benefit from the growing lithium demand.” HIGHLIGHTS: ➢ Assay results received for an additional 4,000m of Reverse Circulation drilling completed at the Ewoyaa Main and Grasscutter North targets.➢ Broad, high-grade drill intersections returned at the Ewoyaa Main deposit, including highlights of: o GRC0665: 46m at 1.21% Li2O from 115mo GRC0668: 43m at 1.08% Li2O from 126mo GRC0672: 31m at 1.43% Li2O from 179mo GRC0666: 10m at 1.39% Li2O from 112m**mineralisation open at depth; further assays pending ➢ Newly reported drilling results fall outside the current JORC (2012) Compliant Mineral Resource Estimate and extend mineralisation a further 75m downdip at the Ewoyaa Main deposit, providing confidence in future resource growth potential.➢ Approximately 24,900m of the planned 37,000m resource evaluation and exploration RC and diamond core drilling (“DD”) programme completed to date and planned for completion in Q3 2022.➢ Approximately 8,560m of assay results reported to date from the ongoing 37,000m planned drilling programme; ongoing news flow of drill results.➢ The Company announced a significant Resource upgrade in March 2022 to 30.1Mt at 1.26% Li2O for the Ewoyaa Lithium deposit, which represented a 42% increase from the previous MRE. This included 20.5Mt @ 1.29% Li2O in the Indicated category and was reported in accordance with the JORC Code (2012)
