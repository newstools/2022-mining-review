Renergen has announced the completion of a highly anticipated milestone, with natural gas to plant successfully achieved on 8 July 2022. Gas to plant was achieved and signified by opening of the main inlet line from the gas gathering system, to the process plant and then to the natural gas filtration and pre compression system. The key objectives of introducing gas to plant was to ensure that: Final commissioning workstreams will be completed over the coming weeks, with commercial operation commencing once customer sites are ready to begin accepting product and Renergen expects this to occur towards the end of July 2022. “Successful introduction of gas to plant at our world-class Virginia Gas Project is an incredible achievement and testament to the hard-work and commitment of the entire team. This major milestone has been a long time coming and I am incredibly proud of the efficient progression and success of the Company since acquiring this unknown greenfield asset only a few years ago. “We have worked towards positioning the Virginia Gas Project as a globally significant LNG and helium producer and we are very close to delivering on this goal. Now we know that the plant is safe and critical start-up risks have been addressed, the remaining steps are purely mechanical, which is obviously a major source of relief to everyone. “Speaking on behalf of myself and the board, we honestly could not be prouder of Nick and his team on navigating and developing the Project to this point,” said Stefano Marani, CEO.
