Loncor Gold has applied for an Exploitation Permit for the potential development of the Company’s 1.164 Moz Makapela gold resource found within the Ngayu Greenstone Gold Belt in the northeast of the DRC. Makapela has an indicated mineral resource of 614,200 oz of gold (2.20 Mt grading 8.66 g/t Au) and an inferred mineral resource of 549,600 oz of gold (3.22 Mt grading 5.30 g/t Au) at a 2.75 g/t Au cut-off. The Makapela Project is owned 100% by Loncor and is located approximately 50 km from its flagship 3.66 Moz Adumbi deposit which already has a Mining Permit. The PEA of the Adumbi deposit, the results of which were announced by Loncor in December 2021, did not include the Makapela deposit.

The deposit remains open at depth, along strike, plus has a number of parallel zones that require further investigation. Within close proximity, there are a number of other deposits such as Mokepa and Mongaliema that historically have been drilled and could hold the potential of future ore feed for Makapela. “The award of a Mining Permit at Makapela would create a second avenue to release value held within our deposits, and the Company will continue to analyse both practical and corporate solutions to maximise the value attributed to all of Loncor’s assets.”
