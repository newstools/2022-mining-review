Reactive ground is a term used in the mining industry to describe the condition where an exothermic chemical reaction can occur between sulphide-bearing rock and the ammonium nitrate-based explosives in blast holes. Reactive ground conditions increase the risk of deflagrating explosives and even unplanned detonations. BME, part of the Omnia group, recently experienced unexpected and highly reactive ground conditions at a large open-pit zinc mine in the Northern Cape of South Africa. This white paper by Deon Pieterse, Technical Services Manager and Grant Small, Technical Services Engineer, delves into the occurrence of reactive ground and the steps taken by BME’s technical team to mitigate the risks presented by the challenging conditions.
