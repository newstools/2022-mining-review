Anglo American is in exclusive negotiations with First Mode, and has agreed  to combine Anglo American’s nuGen™ Zero Emissions Haulage Solution (“ZEHS”) with First Mode, the specialist engineering technology company that partnered with Anglo American to develop the nuGen™ ZEHS, the first hydrogen-powered haul truck. First Mode is a creative engineering company that designs technologies focused on zero-emission mobility, decarbonisation of heavy industry, and production and distribution of green hydrogen. Anglo American acquired a 10% strategic equity interest in First Mode in 2021. The Transaction would include Anglo American making an additional capital investment in the combined business which, upon completion of thetransaction, would result in a majority shareholding. The balance of the equity interest at that time would be held by a number of First Mode’s founders and employees. There is no more pressing challenge than the climate crisis. Our next phase of growth will be squarely focused on addressing it: https://t.co/snKpgPSvCi pic.twitter.com/MabERhOreO In addition to accelerating the development and commercialisation of the ZEHS technology, Anglo American says the new combined business would allow strategic third parties to co-invest alongside Anglo American and First Mode, offering the opportunity to accelerate their own decarbonisation and participate in he potential offered by the clean ZEHS technology.

With diesel emissions from its mine haul truck fleets accounting for 10-15% of Anglo American’s total Scope 1 emissions, and haulage trucks accounting for approximately 80% of diesel emissions at open pit mines, nuGen™ ZEHS will play an important role in delivering not only Anglo American’s target of carbon neutral operations by 2040, but alsosupporting the decarbonisation of the mining industry, with potential across other industries.
