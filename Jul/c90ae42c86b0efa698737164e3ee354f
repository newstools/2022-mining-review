20 July 2022 08h30 GMT | 10h30 SAST Improving the efficiency and sustainability of lithium mining is key in the growth of the Electric Vehicle (EV) motor industry, as it relies on this metal to produce battery manufacture. Further, the transition towards a battery-powered life will contribute significantly to climate change mitigation and decarbonization initiatives. Similarly, yet for different reasons, copper mining is also important, with experts forecasting major shortages in the years ahead. This is despite copper’s recycle value being quite high, where premium-grade scrap is said to have circa 95% of the value of the primary metal from newly mined ore. Lithium mining projects are complex to manage, and often come in over-budget and off-schedule​. The involvement of multiple vendors, consultants, and internal ​stakeholders can lead to costly miscommunications​. Further, a lack of common standards across various vendors can lead to extra engineering hours and project delays, and a lack of integration can impact future operations and plant efficiency. Rockwell Automation solutions for lithium and copper mining (amongst other minerals), which in the form of Integrated Architecture can help increase operational efficiency, improve visibility and enable better decision making, enable a modernized and empowered workforce, allowing superior mine-to-market integration, while operational transparency and monitoring help to manage environmental concerns & community integrity. On 20 July at 10:30 am SAST, Rockwell Automation and Mining Review Africa will host a Webinar on how integrated systems and scalable analytics enable improved mine-to-market visibility and allow for better decision-making to build and operate more efficient and sustainable lithium and copper mines.
