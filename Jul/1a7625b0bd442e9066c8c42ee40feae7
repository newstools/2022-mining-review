Awalé Resources has expanded its exploration footprint and focus in the Odienné Iron Oxide Copper Gold district in Côte d’Ivoire. The expansion is executed through an option to purchase agreement with Turaco Gold over the PR 840 “Sienso” permit in Côte d’Ivoire. The new 326 km2 granted permit borders the eastern flank of the recently announced Awale – Newmont Corporation JV project. Company CEO Glen Parsons commented: “This exciting new permit acquisition option sits outside of the Odienné JV area with Newmont but complements Awalé’s 100% owned permit focus in a district which has a similar geological setting to the JV Area. Awalé’s work to date on the Odienné Project has shown potential to host two primary target styles for world-class discoveries: i) the gold-rich Empire corridor in the south and ii) the recently defined Sceptre and Charger IOCG targets copper-gold targets. We look forward to advancing this new permit as well as our applications to similar drill targeting stages.”
