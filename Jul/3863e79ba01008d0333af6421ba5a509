Perseus Mining has completed a FS on the Nkosuo Project, located north-northwest of its Edikan Gold Mine in Ghana, adding substantial Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves to Edikan’s previously published inventory. Perseus’s MD and CEO Jeff Quartermaine said: “The addition of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves from the Nkosuo Project adds significantly to the mine life at Edikan Gold Mine, ensuring operations can continue while Perseus conducts further exploration on the recently acquired Agyakusu Exploration Permit and two other adjoining Exploration Permits that are under option to Perseus. “We believe that the discovery of additional Ore Reserves in trucking distance of existing infrastructure is the most cost effective means available to Perseus of creating value for shareholders. With this objective, further exploration on the nearby tenements will be well funded by Perseus and we are optimistic of discovering further deposits of a similar scale to Nkosuo that will further add to the mine life of the Edikan operation.” Highlights
