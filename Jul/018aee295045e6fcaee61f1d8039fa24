Botswana Diamonds has announced that drilling has started on the recently discovered high-grade geophysical anomalies on Thorny River. A minimum of ten reverse circulation drill holes are planned on four high-grade gravity anomalies and the most prospective target identified by Subterrane.

The objective of the drilling programme is to discover additional blows on the Thorny River property to expand the resource and thus pave the way for a future mining license or permit application(s). Drilling will take around two weeks to complete. Chairman, John Teeling commented: “This is an important next step in our drive to establish a commercial operation at Thorny River. We are hopeful that these additional holes will expand the resource base to allow a financial evaluation of greater potential for the Thorny River diamond project”.
