Barrick Gold’s production in 2022 is expected to increase through the year, and with the stronger Q2performance, it remains on track to achieve 2022 gold and copper guidance1. The company reported preliminary Q2 sales of 1.04 million oz. of gold and 113 million pounds of copper, as well as preliminary Q2 production of 1.04 million oz. of gold and 120 million pounds of copper. The average market price for gold in Q2 was $1,871 per ounce. The average market price for copper in Q2 was $4.32 per pound, however the closing price at the end of Q2 was $3.83 per pound. The company’s second quarter realized copper price2 is expected to be 13-15% below the average second quarter market price for copper, primarily as a result of provisional pricing adjustments3 that reflect the decrease in the copper price near the end of Q2. As expected, preliminary Q2 gold production was higher than Q1 due to a stronger performance across the portfolio, particularly at Carlin, Turquoise Ridge, Veladero, Bulyanhulu and North Mara. This was partially offset by lower production at Cortez due to mine sequencing as it transitions from the end of open pit mining at Pipeline to a newphase at Crossroads, which is expected to underpin stronger performance for the asset in the fourth quarter of 2022. Compared to Q1, Q2 gold cost of sales per ounce4 is expected to be 1% to 3% higher, total cash costs per ounce5 are expected to be 2% to 4% higher and all-in sustaining costs per ounce5 are expected to be 3% to 5% higher.
