In the second quarter of 2022, the West African operations continued their solid performance. Gold production at the Yaramoko Mine is on track to meet the annual guidance range. At the Séguéla gold Project in Côte d’Ivoire, despite the challenges seen in the supply and logistics markets, construction activities are progressing on-time and on-budget with the overall project progress reported at 64% complete as of June 30th. Major equipment packages have started to arrive at site and first gold pour is projected for mid-2023. Fortuna is advancing its organizational infrastructure in Côte d’Ivoire to prepare for the start of operations at Séguéla, as well as establishing a regional office to service both Séguéla and the Yaramoko Mine. Yaramoko Mine, Burkina Faso: Gold production on target to meet the upper range of annual guidance The Yaramoko Mine produced 24,553 oz of gold in the second quarter of 2022 with an average gold head grade of 5.42 g/t, which is in line with the mining sequence and Mineral Reserve estimate. Gold production for the first six months of 2022 totaled 52,788 oz. Lindero Mine, Argentina: Gold production aligned with annual guidance Gold production was 29,016 oz, representing a 49% increase year-over-year. Higher gold production is explained by an increase in performance of the three-stage crushing and stacking circuits, which delivered 99% of the 1.5 Mt of ore placed on the pad in the quarter, compared to 46% or 0.7 Mt of the 1.47 Mt placed in the comparable quarter a year ago. Mine production was 2.2 Mt of mineralized material with a strip ratio of 1:1. RELATED:Fortuna drills 18.3 g/t gold over 11.9 meters at SéguélaFortuna reports net income of US$27.0 million Q2,2022Fortuna Silver Mines: New name in West Africa, but not for long In the second quarter of 2022, a total of 1.5 Mt of ore were placed on the leach pad, averaging 0.74 g/t gold and containing 35,784 oz of gold. During the second quarter, the operation was successful at mitigating and reducing the production shortfall of ore placed on the leach pad experienced in the first quarter by 50%. The operation continues delivering a strong performance aligned with annual guidance. Gold production for the first six months of 2022 totaled 59,084 oz. As part of the continuous measures to improve productivity, management has implemented various high impact optimization initiatives to capture efficiencies at both the processing plant and the mining operation, some of which were implemented during the second quarter. These initiatives include: the optimization of cyanide recovery at the SART plant to significantly reduce fresh make-up cyanide consumption; lowering the consumption of sulfuric acid at the SART plant, whilst maintaining its efficiency rate and copper balance; and optimizing the mining strategy by implementing additional temporary ramps to significantly decrease trucking distance, improve truck productivity, and ultimately reduce trucking hours and total fleet diesel consumption, supporting the Company´s carbon footprint reduction strategy. The operation experienced a positive reconciliation for ore sent to the leach pad during the second quarter, with grades sampled at the plant being 17 percent higher than estimated from the reserve model. San Jose Mine, Mexico: Steady performer, on track to achieve annual guidance In the second quarter of 2022, the San Jose Mine produced 1.38 Moz of silver and 8,295 oz of gold, both on target to meet annual guidance. Measured against the comparable quarter of the previous year, silver and gold production was 15% and 19% lower respectively. The decreases are a result of a combination of 7% lower mill throughput, and lower average head grades of 9% for silver and 13% for gold, which are in line with the mining sequence and Mineral Reserve estimates. Silver and gold production for the first six months of 2022 totaled 2,743,525 oz and 16,534 oz, respectively. The San Jose team has successfully implemented long hole stoping in select areas of the mine in 2022, with the aim to improve production capacity and reduce total mining cost per tonne. In addition, a new underground shotcrete plant was commissioned in the second quarter which is expected to reduce overall mining cycle times and support costs. Caylloma Mine, Peru: Outperformer, on target to meet the upper range of annual guidance The Caylloma Mine produced 267,559 oz of silver in the second quarter of 2022. The operation delivered another strong quarter of operational performance and is tracking well to deliver total production in the upper range of guidance. Silver production for the first six months of 2022 totaled 579,498 oz. Zinc and lead production in the second quarter of 2022 was 10.9 million pounds and 7.6 million pounds, respectively, in line to meet upper range of guidance. Zinc and lead production for the first six months totaled 21,713,328 pounds and 16,770,565 pounds, respectively.
