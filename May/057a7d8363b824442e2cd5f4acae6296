Oriole Resources has provided an update on its 90%-owned Central Licence Package in Central Cameroon. The district-scale CLP comprises eight contiguous licences covering 3,592 km2 of previously unexplored Paleo-Proterozoic to Pan-African age rocks that are highly prospective for orogenic-style gold mineralisation. Oriole Resources CEO, Tim Livesey, said: “It’s great to see such good progress from our early-stage sampling programmes on the eastern CLP prospects. The field crews have been busy with mapping and sample collection – the boots on the ground de-risking that every project requires in the early stages of exploration – trying to cover as much ground as possible before the rains restrict access. $ORR Oriole Resources PLC on its Central Licence Package in Cameroon https://t.co/PtYaQPloui @OrioleResources $S1Y #ORR #S1Y #Katie_Proactive “Orientation work, utilising multi element data, is providing interesting leads, and the potential for identification of overprinting mineralised systems adds a further layer of opportunity. “Through this work, we are seeing yet more evidence that this package of licences has great potential to be a new gold district. “With ongoing mapping, and more sample results in the pipeline, we look forward to updating the markets as we continue to unlock the Project’s exploration potential.”
