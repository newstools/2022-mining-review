Appian Capital Advisory has filed a claim at the High Court of England and Wales seeking compensation from Sibanye-Stillwater and its subsidiary Sibanye BM Brazil for Sibanye’s failure to close on a transaction, together with associated material breaches. The investment advisor says the claim relates to Sibanye’s unlawful breach of two sale and purchase agreements (“SPAs”) for its acquisition of Brazilian mining companies Atlantic Nickel and Mineração Vale Verde from Appian and follows the notice of claim served by Appian on Sibanye in February. “Sibanye’s failure to close the transaction and incorrect public statements in relation to the Santa Rita mine have materially damaged the market perception of Atlantic Nickel and Appian. Through these proceedings, the Company is seeking to recover its losses in full.” Appian said in a recent statement. Appian claims that Sibanye’s termination was based on the incorrect assertion that a geotechnical instability at Atlantic Nickel’s Santa Rita mine constituted a material adverse effect (“MAE”) under the terms of the relevant SPA, while the event that Sibanye had previously assessed as an occurrence “to be anticipated in mature mining operations”, had minimal impact on the mine. According to the media release, Appian considers that Sibanye has improperly relied on the event to avoid its legal obligations and that Sibanye wished to terminate the SPAs for commercial reasons unrelated to the geotechnical event. It is also said that Sibanye has failed to provide Appian with any contemporaneous evidence to support its alleged assessment that the geotechnical instability amounted to an MAE prior to its refusal to close under the SPAs. In response to these grievances, Sibanye-Stillwater has released a statement, acknowledging receipt of Appian’s claim form. The company says that it will defend the claim.
