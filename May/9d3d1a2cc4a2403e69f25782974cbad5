Who would have thought that President Cyril Ramaphosa’s usual charm offensive would not work when he attempted to deliver his Worker’s Day message in Rustenburg on Sunday? Striking miners were having none of his reassurances as they booed him when he took the podium at the Royal Bafokeng Stadium and eventually storming the field and forcing the president to abandon his speech altogether and forcing him to leave the venue. Ramaphosa used his weekly letter to the nation to address the situation. In it he states, “While the main grievance appeared to be about wage negotiations at nearby mines, the workers’ actions demonstrated a broader level of discontent. It reflects a weakening of trust in their union and federation as well as political leadership, including public institutions. These workers wanted to be heard. They wanted their union leaders and government to appreciate their concerns and understand the challenges they face.” In my opinion, the striking mineworkers reflect what many are feeling in the country i.e. we have lost our faith in the ruling party to govern the Rainbow Nation and are tired of government’s rhetoric that all will be well. There is no doubt that the unions hold plenty of political clout in the tripartite alliance comprising COSATU, South African Communist Party and the ANC – enough influence to determine the outcome of the 2024 elections. Is this the Damascene moment that will trigger a series of events that will ultimately bring down the ruling party?
