“Lucara begins the year on a positive trajectory, having fully financed and significantly de-risked our growth plans for the underground expansion in 2021 and delivered another strong quarter of operating and financial results in Q1, reflecting solid performance at the mine combined with continued buoyancy in diamond prices. – Eira Thomas, President & CEO. “Preparation for main shaft sinking is well underway and anticipated to begin in Q2. Our multi-channel approach to sales through tenders, Clara and HB continues to mature, creating alignment along the value chain, delivering efficiencies and higher margins.  Despite current geo-political challenges, Lucara remains optimistic about diamond prices as natural rough diamond supply constraints continue to manifest globally.” Q1,2022 highlights: Consistent with the Company’s approach through 2021, diamond sales continued to be held through a combination of regular tenders, and the Clara platform, for diamonds less than 10.8 carats, and through HB under the sales agreement for those gem and near-gem diamonds greater than 10.8 carats which are to be manufactured and sold as polished. All other diamonds are sold in quarterly tenders. Diamond sales The Company recognized revenue of $68.2 million in the first quarter of 2022 from the sale of 80,295 carats from Karowe. This amount included top-up payments of $11.7 million as well as $1.0 million from the sale of third-party goods on the Clara platform. RELATED:Lucara’s 2021 annual revenue of $230.1 million, increases 84%Lucara’s Karowe – Diamond darling keeps deliveringLucara’s Karowe UGP will add at least US$4 billion in additional revenues In comparison, the Company achieved revenues of $53.1 million from sales of 91,760 carats in the first quarter of 2021 which included top-up payments of $9.1 million as well as $0.1 million in revenue from third-party goods sold through the Clara platform. The exceptionally strong performance throughout 2021 was driven by higher diamond prices which were reflective of the impact of strong demand for both rough and polished diamonds, combined with supply constraints in certain size classes. This strength continued into Q1 2022.  Beginning in Q2 2020, all +10.8 carat diamonds mined from Karowe were delivered to HB pursuant to the terms of the diamond sales agreement described below. HB sales agreement for +10.8 carat diamond production from Karowe Karowe’s large, high value diamonds have historically accounted for approximately 60% to 70% of Lucara’s annual revenues. In 2020, Lucara announced a partnership agreement with HB, entering into a definitive sales agreement for diamonds recovered that exceed +10.8 carats from the Company’s 100% owned Karowe Diamond mine in Botswana. This agreement was subsequently amended and extended to December 31, 2022. The mechanisms of the agreement result in complete transparency within the value chain and create important alignment between the producer and the manufacturer for the first time. Under the amended sales agreement, +10.8 carat gem and near gem diamonds from the Karowe Mine of qualities that can directly enter the manufacturing stream are being sold to HB at prices based on the estimated polished outcome of each diamond. The estimated polished value is determined through state-of-the-art scanning and planning technology, with an adjusted amount payable on actual achieved polished sales, less a fee and the cost of manufacturing. Following the extension of the HB Agreement in 2021, all +10.8 carat non-gem quality diamonds and all diamonds less than 10.8 carats in weight which did not meet the criteria for sale on Clara are being sold as rough through the quarterly tender. In the agreement extension, payment terms were amended to better reflect the timing of mine production and the manufacturing process. This unique pricing mechanism delivers regular cash flow for this important segment of our production profile. For the three months ended March 31, 2022, the Company recorded revenue of $45.2 million from the HB agreement (inclusive of top-up payments of $11.7 million), as compared to revenue of $38.0 million in Q1 2021 (inclusive of top-up payments of $9.1 million). In Q1 2021, all +10.8 carat stones were sold through HB. Beginning in April 2021 when the HB agreement was extended, any +10.8 carat stones not earmarked for manufacturing by HB were sold through the Company’s quarterly tender process. The increase in revenue in Q1 2022 is attributed to higher prices achieved, despite lower sale volumes. This reflects a significant improvement in diamond market fundamentals between the two comparative quarters. Due to natural variability in the quality profile of the +10.8ct production in any production period or fiscal quarter, the recorded revenue and associated top ups will fluctuate. This is expected and reflects a combination of current diamond market prices as well as variability in the quality of Karowe’s production profile in any given period. As a result of the sales agreement with HB, the Company also participated in polished diamond price increases during Q1 2022 as rough diamonds sold to HB in previous quarters were polished and sold. In Q1 2022, top-up payments of $11.7 million (Q1 2021: $9.1 million) were included in revenue for the quarter. At March 31, 2022 a number of higher value and more technically complex stones that take longer to manufacture had not fully completed the manufacturing and sales process. These stones were delivered to HB in 2021 and Q1 2022. As these stones finish the manufacturing process and are sold, the Company’s may record additional revenue in the form of “top-up” payments from these sales. 2022 outlook This section of the press release provides management’s production and cost estimates for 2022.  These are “forward-looking statements” and subject to the cautionary note regarding the risks associated with forward-looking statements. In February 2022, based on updated expectations for revenue in 2022, the diamond revenue guidance issued was increased to between $195.0 million and $225.0 million (from $185.0 million to $215.0 million). Diamond revenue guidance does not include revenue related to the sale of exceptional stones (an individual rough diamond which sells for more than $10 million), or the Sethunya. Clara sales platform Clara, Lucara’s 100% owned proprietary, secure, web-based digital sales platform, continues to gain scale and interest. Interest in Clara continues to grow as the benefits of purchasing rough diamonds in an innovative way become evident. In Q1 2022, three sales (Q1 2021: six sales) took place with a total sales volume transacted of $7.0 million, a 17% increase from the $6.0 million transacted in Q1 2021, reflecting a strong upward price trend observed on Clara during Q1 2022. The number of buyers on the platform increased to 92 at March 31, 2022 with the Company maintaining a waiting list to manage supply and demand. While most of the stones transacted through the platform are supplied from the Karowe Mine, secondary market stones continued to be offered for sale through the platform with good results.  Additional supply is required to meet existing demand and drive the platform’s growth and the Company expects to commence a series of trial sales on the Clara platform with a third-party producer in Q2 2022. The Company intends to continue to seek additional supply in 2022, both from third-party producers and the secondary market. Karowe underground expansion update The Karowe UGP is expected to extend the mine life to at least 2040, with underground carat production predominantly from the highest value EM/PK(S) unit and is forecast to contribute approximately $4 billion in additional revenues, using conservative diamond prices. The Karowe UGP has an estimated $534 million capital cost and a five-year construction period. Mine ramp up is expected in Q1 2026 with full production from the UGP expected in H2 2026. The Company is financing the Karowe UGP through a combination of cash flow from operations and project debt. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, a total of $31.1 million was spent on the Karowe UGP development, primarily in relation to engineering, procurement of long lead items and ongoing construction activities, including: Activities for the UGP in the upcoming quarters of 2022 are expected to include the following:
