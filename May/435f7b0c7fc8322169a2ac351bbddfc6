Barrick Gold Corporation has announced the declaration of a dividend in respect of performance for the first quarter of 2022 that incorporates an enhancement to the base dividend as a result of achieving Level III under the Company’s Performance Dividend Policy. Barrick’s Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.20 per share for the first quarter of 2022 that will be paid on June 15, 2022 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 27, 2022. This dividend comprises a base quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share and a performance dividend enhancement of an additional $0.10 per share. The $0.10 per share enhancement to the base quarterly dividend was achieved as a result of Barrick reporting net cash on its Consolidated Balance Sheet at March 31, 2022 of greater than $0.5 billion and less than $1 billion as per the following schedule: “Our strong operating performance and robust net cash balance has allowed us to provide an enhanced dividend to our shareholders,” says senior executive vice-president and chief financial officer Graham Shuttleworth. “We believe this shows the benefit of the Performance Dividend Policy that we announced in February, including the guidance it provides to our shareholders on future dividend streams.”
