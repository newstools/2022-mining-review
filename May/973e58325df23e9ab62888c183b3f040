Anglo American Platinum has signed a five-year wage agreement with three of its four recognised unions representing 90% of unionised employees, enabling the implementation of the new wage agreement across all relevant employees. The wage agreement increases the salary and salary-related allowances which will increase the total labour cost-to company, on average by 6.6 % per annum over the five-year period. The agreement has been signed before the expiry of the current agreement and will be implemented from 1 July 2022. The labour unions involved include the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (“AMCU”), The National Union of Mineworkers (“NUM”) and UASA – The Union (“UASA”). “Our unions, as representatives of our employees, are an important stakeholder. We are very pleased to have reached an agreement, and we thank them for their engagement, collaboration, and constructive feedback throughout the wage negotiation process, ensuring stability at our operations. Said Natascha Viljoen, CEO of Anglo-American Platinum. Viljoen says that she believes that the multi-year agreement will enable Anglo-American Platinum to remain sustainable through PGM price cycles, while ensuring that their employees are rewarded for their work.
