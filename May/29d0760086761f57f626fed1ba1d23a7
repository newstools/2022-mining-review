Moody’s Investors Service has upgraded Sibanye Stillwater’s corporate family rating (CFR) from Ba3 to Ba2 with a positive outlook. The upgrade alludes to the strong financial performance that Sibanye has displayed over the past two years and its track record of maintaining capital allocation discipline.

According to Moody’s, the company has used its strong cash flows to balance various strategic objectives, including strengthening its balance sheet and enhancing liquidity, investing in existing assets, and executing its strategy to expand into battery metals, as well as rewarding shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. The rating upgrade comes after workers at Sibanye have downed tools for nearly 2 months, demanding an R1000 salary against the offered R850. Mining unions are still not budging, causing operations to be on standstill. “Our offer is fair, takes into account inflationary living costs, considers the sustainability of the SA gold operations, and is in the interests of all stakeholders. We urge employees to carefully consider the offer we have made and to ensure that their voices are heard,” says Richard Cox, Executive Vice President – SA Gold Operations.
