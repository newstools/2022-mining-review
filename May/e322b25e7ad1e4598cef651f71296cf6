Lotus Resources has provided an update regarding the company’s recent trip to Malawi. Senior management held positive talks with senior figures from the Malawian Government and ESCOM as well as with local communities all centred on the prospective recommencement of production at the Company’s Kayelekera uranium mine. Keith Bowes, Managing Director of Lotus, commented: “After a two-year hiatus in travel due to COVID restrictions it was great to get back in-country again to visit site and meet with various government officials. “I was extremely pleased with the warm reception we received from all parties that we met, and it is obvious there is strong support from government, communities, and NGOs for Kayelekera to restart production as soon as possible. “The trip also provided the opportunity to visit site again and meet our local employees who have been doing a fantastic job in maintaining site while working with local communities and regional government officials to explain the process and requirements to be met before we can restart the mine. “Communication is key and everyone is working hard to strengthen our social licence to operate. I was particularly happy to see the support from the local NGOs and the work they have been doing with the communities in formulating our Community Development Agreement that will be key to ensuring our activities support all local communities in a fair and transparent manner.”
