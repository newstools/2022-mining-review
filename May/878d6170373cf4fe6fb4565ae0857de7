WEBINAR DATE: 22 June 2022 TIME:  08h30 GMT | 10:30am SAST It’s well-known in the industry that Model Predictive Control (MPC) technology can improve throughput, enhance quality, and reduce use of consumables. But what if you knew exactly which process areas to target and how much benefit you could expect to see before investing? Join Rockwell Automation and Mining Review Africa as we bring you a live Webinar session on how MPC can deliver massive project gains. Conducting a thorough study prior to implementation of MPC technology brings focus to projects and identifies potential improvements and business benefits before the work even begins. MPC uses a model of the process to predict how the process output variables will respond to changes in the process input variables and disturbances. MPC algorithms making use of ML, where the machine learn engine learns and updates the mathematical model using data while the MPC then uses it for control. Target-specific KPIs like product quality, specific energy costs and tons of product produced. Then use those KPIs to achieve a targeted balance within equipment and quality limits. Speakers: Juliano de Goes Arantes – Digital Account Executive EMEA, Rockwell Automation Steffen Zendler – Heavy Industry Strategy & Marketing Manager EMEA, Rockwell Automation  REGISTER BELOW for the Webinar and learn how Rockwell Automation is helping customers drive maximum results with MPC!
